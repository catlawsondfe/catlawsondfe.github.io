	<p>When you submit your school census data on COLLECT, the system runs a number of validation checks against the data. It will highlight any errors or queries in red against the relevant data item.</p>
	
	<p>Youâ€™ll get an error when data rules are broken, for example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the return contains an â€˜illegal characterâ€™</li>
	<li>a value may be out of range</li>
	<li>data is missing</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You must correct all errors.</p>
	
	<p>You will get a query where the data is unusual or unexpected which could mean an inaccuracy or omission in the data, for example where:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>no pupils are reported as having special educational needs</li>
	<li>there is a probability of data being omitted such as permanent exclusions</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You must investigate all queries and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>amend the data</li>
	<li>provide suitable notepad explanations in COLLECT</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Your software may contain data checks, which will help you to identify and correct errors and inconsistencies in your data before it generates your school census return.</p>
	
	<p>Along with the school summary, errors and queries, there are a number of reports in COLLECT which you should use to check your data.</p>
	
	<h2 id="viewing-your-errors-and-queries">Viewing your errors and queries</h2>
	
	<p>You can view the errors and queries from within (or once youâ€™ve opened) the school census return in COLLECT.</p>
	
	<ol class="steps">
	<li>
	<p>Click on â€˜all errorsâ€™ at the top of the screen to see a list of all errors and queries relating to your return.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click on the details button to see which data items the validation is checking. If you click on one of the underlined fields, you will see the corresponding data item in the return.</p>
	</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There are 2 levels of errors, â€˜return levelâ€™ and â€˜data item levelâ€™. Return level errors relate to your whole return rather than an individual data item.</p>
	
	<h2 id="correcting-errors">Correcting errors</h2>
	
	<p>You can identify which data contains the incorrect value by clicking on the field value in the details section in COLLECT.</p>
	
	<p>To resolve errors we recommend that schools correct the data in their management information system (<abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr>), then reload their data collection file to COLLECT, overwriting the incorrect one.</p>
	
	<h2 id="adding-explanation-notes-for-queries">Adding explanation notes for queries</h2>
	
	<p>You need to provide explanatory information for individual queries as a note on COLLECT. All queries need an explanation but you can enter one note to cover numerous queries.</p>
	
	<p>You can add notes in the â€˜return level notesâ€™ section. <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collect-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities">COLLECT guides</a> for schools and local authorities are available for assistance.</p>
	
	<ol class="steps">
	<li>
	<p>To add a return level note double click on the pen or notepad (where there is already a note present) icon in the return level notes section.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click add new note.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Type the error or query number along with your explanation in the box provided, ensuring you provide an explanation for all of your unresolvable errors and queries.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click create to save your notes. Once saved, you are unable to edit the note however, you can add further notes to supplement throughout the collection.</p>

	<h2 id="collect-reports">COLLECT reports</h2>
	
	<p>The school census data will be used to finalise 2020 to 2021 funding allocations. It is important that you check the accuracy of your schoolsâ€™ returns before you submit them.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of reports in COLLECT which you should use to check your data.</p>
	
	<p>You can access your reports using the â€˜launch reportsâ€™ button on the school â€˜source pageâ€™ of COLLECT. Some reports only get updated overnight.</p>
	
	<p>Find out how to run these reports in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collect-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities">COLLECT guides for schools and local authorities</a>.</p>

	
	<h2 id="available-collect-reports">Available COLLECT reports</h2>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-number-report">Pupil number report</h3>
	
	<p>Provides a headcount of your pupils by NC year group, headcount of your pupils minus subsidiary registrations and the number of pupils that will be used in numerous funding streams and therefore will account for funded and extended hours and unresolved duplicate UPNs.</p>
	
	<h3 id="duplicate-unique-pupil-number-upn-and-duplicate-pupil-report">Duplicate unique pupil number (<abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>) and duplicate pupil report</h3>
	
	<p>The duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> report shows any pupils appearing on your census and that of another school where there is an invalid combination of enrolment statuses. Your funding may be affected if these remain unresolved at database closure.</p>
	
	<p>The duplicate pupil report identifies pupils whose personal details are the same but the <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> differs.</p>
	
	<h3 id="free-school-meals-fsm-report">Free school meals (<abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr>) report</h3>
	
	<p>Allows schools to check the <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> eligibility data submitted in their census return. This report only refers to <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> eligibility reported in the current census and not the <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> ever measure used to allocate the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<h3 id="universal-infant-free-school-meals">Universal infant free school meals</h3>
	
	<p>Provides a breakdown of the infant pupils that we will use in the universal infant free school meals funding calculation.</p>
	
	<h4 id="zero-funded-hours">Zero funded hours</h4>
	
	<p>Highlights the number of early years pupils who have â€˜zeroâ€™ funded hours recorded on the school census return. We use funded hours to calculate the early years block of the dedicated schools grant.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-premium">Pupil premium</h3>
	
	<p>Allows schools to check and verify the data in their spring school census, which will feed into the deprivation, service child and post looked after children report elements of the pupil premium allocation.</p>
	
	<h3 id="early-years-pupil-premium">Early years pupil premium</h3>
	
	<p>Allows schools to check and verify the data in their spring school census, which we use for the early years pupil premium allocations.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-16-funding-reports">Post-16 funding reports</h3>
	
	<p>Schools will also be able to access a series of <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> funding reports in the autumn census. These reports show schools the data we will use for our post-16 funding calculations:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>funded student summary report</li>
	<li>student detail report</li>
	<li>16 to 19 maths and English GCSE status by student</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="duplicate-report-guidance">Duplicate report guidance</h2>
	
	<p>Duplicate reports indicate pupils who are registered at more than one school.</p>
	
	<p>These reports look for duplicates across all pupils on roll in the current school census only. Reports will not look for duplicates between the school census and any other pupil level collections, such as the alternative provision census and early years census.</p>
	
	<h2 id="duplicate-report-same-upn">Duplicate report: same <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>
	</h2>
	
	<p>A unique pupil number (<abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>) identifies each individual learner in England. Learnersâ€™ UPNs are intended to remain with them throughout their school career regardless of any change in school or local authority.</p>
	
	<p>A duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> is one where more than one pupil registration shares the same <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> and the registrations sharing the <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> have an invalid combination of enrolment statuses.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
	
	<p>A pupil where the same <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> is recorded against 2 registrations with a main registration (â€˜Mâ€™) at one school and a subsidiary registration (â€˜Sâ€™) at another school is not a duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>. This is because it is a valid combination of enrolment status for dual registered pupils.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>â€˜Mâ€™ and â€˜Sâ€™ is the only valid combinations of pupil enrolment status codes for pairs of duplicate UPNs.</p>
	
	<p>As unresolved duplicates will impact on funding allocations such as the dedicated schools grant and pupil premium, we expect local authorities, non-maintained special schools, academies and CTCs to work together to determine whether the pupils identified in this report are indeed the same pupil.</p>

	<p>Local authorities can access reports through COLLECT showing:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>all pupils where a duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> has been identified within your own authority only</li>
	<li>all pupils where a duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> has been identified within your authority and also in another authority</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="school-reports">School reports</h4>
	
	<p>Each individual school will be able to run a duplicate report showing all pupils within their school where a duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> has been identified looking across all other schools.</p>
	
	<h3 id="identifying-duplicates">Identifying duplicates</h3>
	
	<p>For each on roll pupil included within a return with a status of â€˜loadedâ€™ or above the report will:</p>
	
	<ul>

	<li>identify UPNs where there is an invalid combination of enrolment statuses</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For each duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> identified, the report will contain:</p>

	<h3 id="correcting-duplicates">Correcting duplicates</h3>
	
	<p>To correct duplicates, schools should make the changes on their school management information system and re-submit. This makes sure the schoolâ€™s system matches the position on COLLECT.</p>
	
	<p>Changes could include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>changing the pupilâ€™s registration code to produce a valid combination of enrolment status (for dual registered pupils the only valid combination is M and S)</li>
	<li>deleting the pupil record (only do this if pupil has been entered in error)</li>
	<li>moving the pupil record to â€˜NoLongerOnRollâ€™ adding a date of leaving</li>
	<li>if the pupil was permanently excluded, moving their record to â€˜NoLongerOnRollâ€™, adding a date of leaving and creating an exclusion record</li>
	<li>changing the <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> (only do this if the pupil <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> has been entered incorrectly)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="no-longer-on-roll">No longer on roll</h3>
	
	<p>If the pupil recorded on census left the school before the census date, it is important for attendance data requirements that the pupil is not deleted but moved to â€˜NoLongerOnRollâ€™.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-does-not-arrive-on-expected-start-date">Pupil does not arrive on expected start date</h3>
	
	<p>Schools should follow this process when a pupil does not arrive on the expected start date and has started another school.</p>
	
	<h4 id="enrolment">1. Enrolment</h4>
	
	<p>School A (school expecting a pupil) enters pupil on admission register with enrolment status of C, F or O.</p>

	<h4 id="enrolment-once-school-a-finds-where-pupil-is">4. Enrolment (once school A finds where pupil is)</h4>
	
	<p>School A changes the enrolment status to S (dual subsidiary) (from the date of enrolment to the date of leaving).</p>
	
	<p>School B changes the enrolment status to M (dual main) (from the date of enrolment to the date agreed with school A that the pupil will be made a leaver at school A). The enrolment status reverts to C, F or O from the date that the pupil is marked as a leaver from school A.</p>

	<p>Where the match is correct, and it is the same pupil, they should have the same <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>.</p>

	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="school-report">School report</h4>

	<li>school status</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="correcting-duplicates-1">Correcting duplicates</h3>
	
	<p>To correct duplicates, schools should make the changes on their school management information system and re-submit. This ensures the schoolâ€™s system matches the position on COLLECT.</p>
	
	<p>Where it is the same pupil, they should have the same <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> and you will need to amend one record. The 2 records should also have the correct combination of enrolment statuses otherwise they will then appear on the duplicate <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> report, so if dual registered, one registration should have a dual main registration (â€˜Mâ€™) and the other should have a dual subsidiary registration (â€˜Sâ€™).</p>
	
	<p>Changes could include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>same pupil: change one of the UPNs</li>
	<li>same pupil and pupil is dually registered: change one of the UPNs and make sure the pupil is recorded as dual main at one registration and dual subsidiary at the other</li>
	<li>same pupil but pupil is off roll: one record to be moved to â€˜NoLongerOnRollâ€™ with date of leaving provided and change one of the UPNs</li>
	<li>pupil was permanently excluded: pupil record to be moved to â€˜NoLongerOnRollâ€™, date of leaving provided, create an exclusion record and change one of the UPNs</li>
	<li>one record is entered in error: delete one of the records</li>
	<li>different pupil: report back as false duplicate</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="false-matches">False matches</h3>
	
	<p>If the 2 duplicate records are in fact different pupils and the match is incorrect, you can notify us of false matches and we will build these into COLLECT and take them into account for future reports and censuses. This will save you checking the same pupil every census.</p>
	
	<p>To notify us of false duplicates, export your report and then simply put in â€˜Fâ€™ after the last column on your duplicate pupilsâ€™ sheet after each pupil to indicate that the pair of duplicates is a false match and it is different pupils. Save the file and return to us using the <abbr title="school to school">S2S</abbr> site at any time during a census. We will update the list in COLLECT once a week, so you may not notice a change on your report immediately.</p>
	
	<p>To use the <abbr title="school to school">S2S</abbr> website you will need to follow this file naming convention:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>local authorities: LALLLL_DFESXXX_DupPupils.ext - <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is your 3 digit local authority number and ext is the file extension for example, xls, csv, txt</li>

	<p>The COLLECT funding report will contain a full breakdown of the pupil numbers from the autumn 2019 school census. We will use this in the calculation of the schools block element of your dedicated schools grant allocation for 2020 to 2021.</p>
	
	<p>The funding reports should update daily and take into account the duplicates report. It reflects the position from COLLECT as at close the previous working day.</p>
	
	<h3 id="to-2021-dedicated-schools-grant-allocation-schools-block">2020 to 2021 dedicated schools grant allocation: schools block</h3>
	
	<p>The funding methodology for 2020 to 2021 has not changed from 2019 to 2020. The schools block of the 2020 to 2021 dedicated schools grant allocation will again be calculated based on sole and dual main registered pupils attending local authority maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools and mainstream academies who are:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>aged 4 and above as at 31 August 2019 in national curriculum year group reception to year 11 at the time of the census</li>
	<li>aged 4 to 15 as at 31 August 2019 where national curriculum year groups do not apply (those in national curriculum year group X) at the time of the census</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>All pupils will be funded as 1 full time equivalent irrespective of the full time / part time status or funded hours recorded on the census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="to-2021-growth-funding">2020 to 2021 growth funding</h3>
	
	<p>Growth funding enables local authorities to support schools with significant in-year pupil growth, which is not otherwise immediately recognised by the current lagged funding system. Local authorities may also retain a small fund to support schools with temporarily falling rolls. Local authorities will continue to manage their growth funding locally in 2019 to 2020 as they did in 2018 to 2019.</p>
	
	<p>Although growth allocations for 2019 to 2020 will be based on pupil data from the autumn census, the pupil numbers that will be used in the calculation of this growth funding allocated are not included within the COLLECT funding report. We will provide local authorities with a data tool in the autumn to support them in predicting what their growth allocation for 2019 to 2020 is likely to be, allowing them to input the latest pupil numbers they hold.</p>
	
	<h3 id="reports-available-2">Reports available</h3>
	<p>There are 2 versions of this report available for local authorities to run.</p>
	
	<h4 id="funding-report-run-against-approved-data">Funding report run against approved data</h4>
	<p>This version of the funding report will include data from schools whose return status is â€˜approvedâ€™ or above. It will reflect the data which we use in your dedicated schools grant allocation. We will only fund based on data which has been approved by local authorities.</p>
	
	<h4 id="funding-report-run-against-data-all-loaded-data">Funding report run against data all loaded data</h4>
	<p>This version of the funding report will be identical in format to the funding report run against â€˜approvedâ€™ data but will include all loaded data from schools in your local authority.</p>
	
	<p>As the data may change at the loaded and submitted stage, please do not send queries about discrepancies in the data in your funding report until the returns are at the â€˜approvedâ€™ stage.</p>
	
	<h3 id="how-to-use-the-local-authority-funding-report">How to use the local authority funding report</h3>
	
	<p>You should check and verify these funding reports with local authority finance officers before the autumn census database closes on 27 November 2019. Itâ€™s not possible to make amendments to your return after this date.</p>
	
	<p>We cannot identify pupils in special units and specially resourced provision within mainstream schools that will be funded via the high needs block from the data collected in the autumn census. This means that these pupils cannot be excluded from the autumn census schools block COLLECT funding report and so the pupil numbers in this funding report may not match your final schools block allocation. We will adjust the numbers based on the data provided to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> by local authorities via their high needs tables.</p>

	<h2 id="to-19-funding-reports---autumn">16 to 19 funding reports - autumn</h2>
	
	<p>We base post-16 funding allocations on census data from individual institutions, so returning accurate data is a key factor in ensuring that you receive the right allocation.</p>
	
	<p>The reports are based on the data you submitted in your autumn census, and will help you check, validate and quality assure your submission. We have worked hard to ensure these reports reflect the 16 to 19 funding methodology as closely as possible. The categories and values shown in the reports are indicative and will not necessarily directly match those in your 16 to 19 allocation.</p>
	
	<p>We have introduced 4 new fields that record studentsâ€™ English and maths highest prior attainment, and planned qualification and non-qualification hours for the previous year. The information in these fields makes our funding calculations more accurate.</p>

	<p>The 16 to 19 funded student summary report shows the number of students who are eligible for 16 to 19 funding, according to the data returned in the census. The students are grouped according to their funding line type and their funding band.</p>
	
	<p>The report only shows students:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>whose enrolment status is current (C) or main (M) - students with dual subsidiary status (S) are funded through other institutionsâ€™ allocations and students with guest status (G) are excluded from the census return</li>
	<li>who have stayed on their study programmes long enough to count as valid starts - you can find more information on this in the â€˜student numbersâ€™ and â€˜SN examplesâ€™ sections of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interactive-post-16-school-census-tool">interactive post-16 school census tool</a>

	</li>
	<li>who are recorded in national curriculum years 12, 13, or 14 in the relevant academic year</li>
	<li>who have learning aims in the relevant academic year</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The report splits the number of students into 3 categories by funding line type. This allows you to make sure that students are correctly recorded in the census with regard to their age and special educational needs (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>) provision.</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>16 to 19 students (including high needs students). All 16 to 19 students are included in this funding line type, regardless of their <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision indicator.</li>
	<li>19 to 24 students with an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan. 19 to 24 year old students not recorded as having an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> Plan will be placed in the â€˜19+ continuing studentsâ€™ funding line.</li>
	<li>19+ continuing students (excluding students with an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan). This category includes any 19 to 24 year old students not recorded as having an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The report also splits students by funding band, within funding line types. This allows you to make sure that the studentâ€™s planned hours are correctly recorded in the census. Funding band is determined by the total of planned learning hours and planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours.</p>
	
	<p>The report uses these fields from your census return:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>planned learning hours (previous year or current year)</li>
	<li>planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours (previous year or current year)</li>
	<li>enrolment status</li>

	<p>The 16 to 19 student detail report shows all students who are recorded in the census with basic post 16 eligibility, regardless of whether they qualify as a start or not. This is different to the 16 to 19 funded student summary report, which only shows students who are valid starts.</p>
	
	<p>The report uses the same other criteria as the 16 to 19 funded student summary report. It shows students:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>whose enrolment status is current (C) or main (M)</li>
	<li>who are recorded in national curriculum years 12, 13, or 14 in the relevant academic year</li>
	<li>who have learning aims in the relevant academic year</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It shows information for each student, grouped according to their funding line type.</p>
	
	<p>The report shows:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>unique pupil number (<abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>)</li>
	<li>studentâ€™s surname, forename and date of birth</li>
	<li>planned learning hours</li>
	<li>planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours</li>
	<li>total planned hours - planned learning hours plus planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours</li>
	<li>funding band, which is determined by the total planned hours</li>
	<li>whether the student qualifies for funding (students who qualify for funding are shown with the status of â€˜1â€™, students who do not qualify are shown with the status of â€˜0â€™)</li>
	<li>national curriculum year - we only include students in the reports when they are in years 12, 13, and 14</li>
	<li>any disadvantage block 1 funding - this field shows you the disadvantage uplift each student generates based on their home postcode</li>
	<li>any instances of disadvantage block 2 - this information is from the values you returned in the English and maths prior attainment year group fields</li>
	<li>programme type - if you think a student has an incorrect programme type in this field you should review the recording of your core aims and learning aim status</li>
	<li>programme cost weighting - this field shows you the programme cost weighting uplift attracted by your students undertaking vocational study programmes</li>
	<li>retention - if you have students who are not retained, whom you expected to be retained, you should check you have recorded a core aim for an academic programme, and that the student does not have a vocational core aim</li>

	<li>whose enrolment status is current (C) or main (M)</li>
	<li>who have stayed on their study programmes long enough to count as valid starts</li>

	<li>date of birth</li>
	<li>maths status</li>
	<li>English status</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The maths/English field of the report will show one of the following statuses.</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Condition of funding does not apply - for students you record on small part time study programmes (under 150 hours per year), and for students who are aged 15 or under.</li>
	<li>Exempt from the GCSE maths/English A* to C or 9-4 requirement - for students you record as being exempt from the condition of funding.</li>
	<li>Has maths/English, studying maths/English - the student has met the condition of funding through prior attainment, but is also studying for a valid qualification for the condition of funding. This status is most likely to show when a student is studying for an A level in maths or English, as these are valid qualifications for the condition of funding.</li>
	<li>Has maths/English, not studying maths/English - the student has met the condition of funding through prior attainment and is not undertaking a valid maths/English qualification.</li>
	<li>Has maths/English GCSE grade D/3, not studying GCSE maths/English - students who start a new full time programme who hold a grade D or grade 3 in the relevant subject must study for a valid GCSE qualification rather than a stepping stone qualification, such as functional skills. These students will not attract full funding when your allocation is calculated.</li>
	<li>Has English below GCSE grade D or grade 3, holds maths/English FSL2 pass - students who do not have a GCSE at grade C or grade 4 in maths or English meet the condition of funding if they have achieved a level 2 functional skill in the subject.</li>
	<li>Doesnâ€™t have maths/English, studying maths/English - the student meets the condition of funding not through prior attainment but because they are studying a valid qualification for the condition of funding.</li>
	<li>Doesnâ€™t have maths/English, not studying maths/English - students who do not have at least a GCSE grade C or grade 4 in the relevant subject and who are not studying for a valid condition of funding qualification do not meet the condition. These students will not attract full funding when your allocation is calculated.</li>

	<h4 id="out-of-date-qualification-numbers">Out of date qualification numbers</h4>
	
	<p>An out of date maths or English qualification will not count towards the condition of funding and so the student will not be compliant.</p>
	
	<p>You should check:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>that all qualifications recorded using the correct qualification number for the course</li>
	<li>that all qualification numbers are in date by making sure the start date of the aim falls between the funding validity start and end dates â€“ you can find these dates in <a rel="external" href="https://collectdata.education.gov.uk/qwsweb/(S(mdzfjbijwn3epz2i4uleir45))/default.aspx">QAN Web Services (<abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr>)</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Learning%20Aims/Pages/default.aspx"><abbr title="Learning Aims Reference Service">LARS</abbr></a>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="incorrectly-recorded-planned-hours">Incorrectly recorded planned hours</h4>
	
	<p>Your planned hours should reflect the planned activity for the academic year covering both qualification and non-qualification activity in the relevant fields.</p>
	
	<p>If you donâ€™t return any planned hours for a student, that student wonâ€™t generate any funding.</p>
	
	<p>Under-recording planned hours (often a result of recording qualification hours but not non-qualification hours) is likely to result in a student being funded at a lower level than they should be.</p>
	
	<p>You should also check you have correctly recorded any high need students in receipt of element 3 top-up funding using the top-up funding indicator.</p>
	
	<p>As we have introduced new fields that record planned qualification and non-qualification hours for the previous year, you should check the hours recorded for both years are correct. We will use the information in the previous year fields to calculate the funding bands used for your 2020 to 2021 allocation. If the information is incorrect, this may have a negative effect on your allocation as the calculation puts students in the wrong funding bands.</p>
	
	<h4 id="incorrectly-recorded-start-planned-end-or-actual-end-dates">Incorrectly recorded start, planned end or actual end dates</h4>
	
	<p>You should check that you have:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>recorded the correct year for each date</li>
	<li>recorded any learning aims spanning more than one academic year with the start and end dates reflecting this multi-year delivery and not as separate learning aims for each year</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="incorrect-recording-of-or-failure-to-record-maths-and-english-prior-attainment-grades">Incorrect recording of or failure to record maths and English prior attainment grades</h4>
	
	<p>Prior attainment grades indicate whether or not a student needs to take approved maths and/or English qualifications to meet the condition of funding.</p>
	
	<p>If the grade is missing, we assume the student does not hold the relevant qualification and has to take an approved qualification.</p>
	
	<p>If the student is not enrolled on a suitable qualification or an incorrect prior attainment is recorded, they will not meet the condition of funding.</p>
	
	<h4 id="incorrectly-recording-transfers">Incorrectly recording transfers</h4>
	
	<p>When a student transfers (for example, they stop studying one qualification and take up another in its place, while staying at the same institution), you must record them with learning aim status 4.</p>
	
	<p>If you record them with status 3 (withdrawn), then the elements that use the status may be incorrectly calculated.</p>
	
	<h4 id="incorrectly-recording-core-aims">Incorrectly recording core aims</h4>
	
	<p>We use the core aim to determine if a studentâ€™s programme is academic or vocational (those with a core aim are vocational and those without are academic), and which retention criteria we apply.</p>

	<p>It is not possible to provide a COLLECT report during the live census collection period containing details of these pupil numbers for a particular school or local authority.
