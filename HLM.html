	<p>You’ll find it easier to communicate with your baby if you:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>give baby your full attention by putting your phone on silent, or turning off the TV</li>
	<li>have lots of eye contact</li>
	<li>smile and use expression</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don’t forget that babies get tired easily so if baby cries or seems restless it might be time for a break. Give baby some downtime and try again another time.</p>

	<p>At mealtimes, give your child choices, so that they can hear and understand more words. For example, ‘Do you want an apple or an orange?’ Make sure you give them time to answer.</p>
	<p>Say the names of the foods your child is eating and talk about what they’re like, using words like ‘crunchy’, ‘squishy’, ‘sour’, ‘cold’, ‘warm’.<br />
	Pretend to be a dinosaur eating trees as you bite into some broccoli, or a monkey enjoying a slice of banana. Make sure that both you and your child have some food to try!</p>

	<p>Play with your child with things they are interested in. Start a simple game with them by making a story together out of your child’s favourite teddy. Then encourage your child to take the lead.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Do some colouring-in with your child, by drawing your own pictures or searching online. Make the game fun and talk about the pictures and colours while you are playing.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Look at picture books together. Give your child time to point out things to you. Talk about what they can see using words for actions as well as for things – for example, ‘The monkey is eating.’</p>

	<p>Talk about your daily tasks. When you’re hanging up the washing, you could say ‘The clothes are wet, let’s hang them up to dry.’ Give them simple tasks like passing you the socks. Praise them for helping.</p>

	<p>Take photos of what your child does during the day and talk about the pictures. For example, ‘you ate breakfast. You brushed your teeth.’</p>
	<hr />
	<p>When you’re out and about, build on what your child says about what they can see – so when they say ‘Big bird!’ you can say, ‘Yes, it’s a big, noisy bird called a crow’.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Talk to your child about what has happened so far in the day – for example, ‘We went to the shops this morning, didn’t we? We bought some apples.’ And talk about what is going to happen next – ‘After lunch we’ll do the washing up.’</p>

	<p>Sing songs together that encourage your child to use their imagination. For example, sing The Wheels on the Bus and ask your child to suggest other things on the bus and describe what sound they make.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Read picture books together. Sit close together or even build a den together to sit in. Talk about the things they can see and how we use them. For example, ‘A bed is something we sleep in.’</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Put on some music and play ‘musical statues’. Dance together then stop the music – see who will be the first person to stand still and talk about the silly positions you are stuck in!</p>

	<p>Collect some objects together from around your home or garden. Encourage your child to describe the object – ‘is it smooth?’ ‘heavy?’. Put some water in a bowl and encourage your child to choose an object and put it into the water. Ask them ‘do you think it will float or sink?’</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play games like, ‘I spy with my little eye something beginning with…’ and say the first sound of the thing that you can see – ‘something beginning with b-b-b-b.’ You can go first and show your child how the game works.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Think of as many rhyming words as you can for different objects you can see. For example, if you can both see a tree, then think of as many words as you can that rhyme with it like bee, knee, me.</p>

	<p>Start conversations by using open questions with lots of possible answers, for example, ‘What are you going to play with today?’, ‘What did you do at the park yesterday?’</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Try role-playing games together such as shopping. Set items out on the sofa, give your child a bag and some pretend money. Then switch roles and let them be the shopkeeper.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play teddy bears’ picnic. Put soft toys in a circle and give your child a few cups and spoons. Give your child a chance to tell you what to do like, ‘Stir teddy’s tea.’ You could chat to them as you are doing actions, for example, ‘let’s cut the cake in half’.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Plan a treasure hunt game, where your child has to listen to your instructions to find a clue or an object. For example, ‘Try looking behind the sofa’. Help your child look for a specific number of objects and count them together – such as 3 cups, 2 pink socks, 5 pens.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play a make-believe journey game with your child. Make a car out of a cardboard box that you decorate together, or just grab some cushions, pile in a few teddy bear passengers, and let your child drive you off on an adventure.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Obstacle courses are great fun and can help your child to listen and learn new words. You can play them inside or outside, just give your child some instructions. Say &#8216;crawl under the blanket&#8217; or &#8216;sit in the box&#8217; or &#8216;jump to the corner&#8217;. Take turns so that they can practice giving the instructions too.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play Follow the Leader. Make sure you talk about what you’re doing and repeat words lots of times! For example, ‘Simon says shake your hands, shake, shake, shake’, ‘Simon says stamp your feet, stamp, stamp, stamp’. Include opposites in the instructions (up/down, stop/go, loud/soft, high/low) and take turns!</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Try sharing familiar books at bedtime. Pause when reading so that your child can join in. Talk about the sounds at the beginning of words and words that start with the same sound (like words beginning with P).</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Encourage your child to recall what has happened in the story. For example, ‘Why is bear feeling sad?’ Ask them to guess what might happen – ‘What should they do next?’ – or how the story might end – ‘Do you think they’re going to find the treasure? Where could it be?’</p>

	<div id="details-content-0" class="rich-text">
	<p>There are lots of apps that say they are &#8216;educational&#8217;, but you&#8217;ll want to reassure yourself that&#8217;s the case and that they are right for your child. The FEED check may help.</p>
	<p><strong>Fun</strong> &#8211; Will your child enjoy the app? Will it keep their attention?</p>
	<p><strong>Educational</strong> &#8211; Is there a clear educational aim? Do you know what your child will learn? Will it keep them learning and allow them to progress?</p>
	<p><strong>Engaging</strong> &#8211; Will it help your child if they get stuck? Will it give them feedback and let them know when they&#8217;ve got challenges right?</p>
	<p><strong>Design</strong> &#8211; Is it attractive and easy to use? Is it inclusive and does it avoid gender and racial stereotypes? Can an adult change the settings? Is it safe, with links to the internet and adverts protected behind a parental gate?</p>
