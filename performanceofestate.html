	      <p>You will need a variety of information to help you manage the estate effectively. You should have the relevant policies and procedures in place to collect this.</p>
	

	<h2 id="creating-an-estate-budget-plan">Creating an estate budget plan</h2>
	

	<p>You should have a 3 to 5 year budget plan for the estate, signed off by your board. This should include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>a prioritised maintenance plan</li>
	  <li>how you will achieve value for money through investment</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Good estate management supports the effective management and use of financial resources. This should include both capital and revenue expenditure, which are often managed as separate funding strands. This will inform your decision making process.</p>
	

	<h3 id="importance-of-budgeting-and-finance">Importance of budgeting and finance</h3>
	

	<p>With increasing pressures on all budgets, itâ€™s important that you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>understand how all your resources are used</li>
	  <li>challenge yourself to use them more efficiently</li>
	  <li>get value for money from the estate</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Doing this will help you get the right combination of costs and benefits, not necessarily the cheapest service or product.</p>
	

	<p>Thinking about the estate strategically will help you do this by:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>providing a framework to identify issues and recognise risks early</li>
	  <li>forecasting investment need in the short, medium and longer term</li>
	  <li>identifying capital budgeting requirements, enabling consideration alongside revenue budget planning</li>
	  <li>helping you sequence and prioritise works to maximise outcomes</li>
	  <li>coordinating efficient procurement of services</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="responsibility-for-estate-budgeting-and-finance">Responsibility for estate budgeting and finance</h3>
	

	<p>Accountability for financial performance sits at board level. Itâ€™s important that the budgetary process sits firmly within the strategic leadership of the board.</p>
	

	<p>Budgeting and finance management is not the sole responsibility of the school business professional in their capacity as finance manager.</p>
	

	<p>Budgeting for the strategic management of the estate is an integral part of the budget planning cycle. It should not be treated as a standalone item.</p>
	

	<p>Budget management in schools can be varied and complex. The executive leader responsible for the estate should work with the school business professional to make sure the estate budget and financing issues are represented in the overall budget planning cycle.</p>
	

	<p>This will draw on analysis of data, which you should present through your asset management plan.</p>
	

	<h3 id="considerations-for-budgeting-and-finance">Considerations for budgeting and finance</h3>
	

	<p>When agreeing the estate budgeting and finance arrangements you should consider the following areas.</p>
	

	<h4 id="capital-and-revenue-budgets">Capital and revenue budgets</h4>
	

	<p>The operation of the estate will impact both capital and revenue budgets. Capital projects could include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>internal alterations</li>
	  <li>extensions or new buildings</li>
	  <li>invest to save schemes</li>
	  <li>improvement works to ensure the sustainability of the estate through asset change</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Revenue costs are associated with the operational running of the estate, including facilities management costs.</p>
	

	<p>You should know the full cost of occupying the estate. This can be a challenge if you have:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>inconsistent budget recording</li>
	  <li>fragmented responsibilities and data recording</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Understanding the financial implications of proposals as a whole supports:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>better decision-making</li>
	  <li>delivery of best value for money</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should consider the revenue implications of any investment in the estate in the short, medium and long term.</p>
	

	<p>Capital projects may have revenue implications that you need to consider in your decision making.</p>
	

	<p>You should consider invest to save projects, which could reduce revenue expenditure in the future.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	Investing in new glazing or constructing a draught lobby could save energy costs.</p>
	

	<p>Replacing an aging roof could save ongoing and increasing maintenance costs.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>You should be aware if there is an opportunity cost of occupying your property. This is the value tied up in your asset that you may be able to release.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	If your land and buildings have a high value for an alternative use, you could consider releasing that value by selling all or part of it and providing what you need in a more cost-effective way.</p>
	</div>
	

	<h3 id="prioritisation">Prioritisation</h3>
	

	<p>Prioritising works is important to make sure your budget is used to deliver best value for money overall. Taking a strategic approach identifies investment needs across the whole estate. This will help you to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>plan your budget</li>
	  <li>avoid unexpected budget pressures</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Working this way makes sure that decisions on prioritisation are made in a consistent and transparent way.</p>
	

	<h3 id="risk-management">Risk management</h3>
	

	<p>The budgeting process and prioritisation of funding should take account of risk management.</p>
	

	<p>Whilst risk cannot be completely avoided, recognition of the risks and their impact should be a factor when prioritising expenditure.</p>
	

	<p>As well as financial risks (both capital and revenue related), consideration should be given to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>risks around statutory compliance</li>
	  <li>educational delivery</li>
	  <li>strategic risk</li>
	  <li>reputational risk</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="option-appraisal">Option appraisal</h3>
	<p>Consideration of significant capital investment options should include appraisal on a whole life basis.</p>
	

	<p>Find out more about option appraisal and whole life considerations.</p>
	

	<h3 id="determining-value-for-money">Determining value for money</h3>
	<p>When determining value for money from investment and the management of the estate, you should consider the:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>potential to reduce revenue expenditure by investing in the estate - this could include invest to save projects</li>
	  <li>options to deliver savings through rationalising the estate - this could include disposing of surplus capacity, releasing costly assets or acquiring more efficient space, including the use of modular buildings</li>
	  <li>potential to generate income through the estate - this could include letting parts of the estate for occasional community use, or longer term release of surplus space</li>
	  <li>options to procure services differently - this could include grouping all your requirements into a single contract or using frameworks for professional services</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="premises-hire-income-generation">Premises hire (income generation)</h2>
	

	<h2 id="tenureandlandownership">Tenure and land ownership - understanding your rights</h2>
	

	<p>Youâ€™ll need a complete understanding of land ownership, rights and obligations to help you manage the estate.</p>
	

	<p>This includes:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>who has a legal or controlling interest in your land and buildings</li>
	  <li>any implications for the use and development of the estate</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The legal interests can affect how you can use the land and buildings.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
	

	<p>If you occupy freehold land, the title may include restrictive covenants that limit what you can do.</p>
	

	<p>If you have a leasehold interest, the terms of the lease may limit what you can do or require you to do certain things.</p>
	

	<p>If the land is owned by a charitable trust, the charityâ€™s governing document may limit what you can do or require you to fulfil specific charitable objects.</p>
	

	<p>If youâ€™re a school with a religious character, you will need the consent of the trustees of the school for any transactions involving the land and buildings.</p>
	

	<p>If youâ€™ve granted leases or other usage agreements to third parties, such as utility companies or local sports teams, these may also limit what you can do.</p>
	</div>
	

	<h3 id="tenure">Legal interests</h3>
	

	<p>Different types of organisations have different levels of control over the use of the land and buildings occupied.</p>
	

	<p>Consider how the legal interests affect:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>developing strategic policies</li>
	  <li>carrying out works</li>
	  <li>letting third parties use the estate</li>
	  <li>changing how you use any of the estate</li>
	  <li>disposing of, or making material changes to, any of the estate</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>This will help you avoid costly mistakes such as:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>financial penalties</li>
	  <li>abortive costs including reinstatement</li>
	  <li>project delays</li>
	  <li>legal actions</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You could also unintentionally create a legal interest, for example by allowing a third party to use the land.</p>
	

	<p>Land and property law can be very complicated. Always seek appropriate professional advice. If youâ€™re a school with a religious character, you should always contact the trustees of the school and the diocese when considering any transactions involving the land and buildings.</p>
	

	<p>Know the terms under which you occupy the land and buildings and the powers and responsibilities granted to you by those terms. Different types of organisations will have different levels of control over the use of the land and buildings occupied.</p>
	

	<p>Depending on your type of school and what you want to do, you may need to speak to your:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>local authority</li>
	  <li>charity trustees</li>
	  <li>trustees of the school</li>
	  <li>board</li>
	  <li>diocesan bishop</li>
	  <li>diocese, diocesan board or other faith body</li>
	  <li>third party owner of land</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="strategic-estate-management">Strategic estate management</h3>
	<p>Understanding land ownership, rights and obligations will make sure you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>have well informed strategic management</li>
	  <li>take account of any legal requirements that have to be met at a specific time</li>
	  <li>make fully informed decisions</li>
	  <li>consider legal process and requirements when appraising options and assessing risks</li>
	  <li>avoid costly mistakes and legal challenges</li>
	  <li>have a formal consistent approach to third parties using the premises where everyone understands their rights and responsibilities</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should consider land ownership, rights and obligations when you develop your <a href="/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/strategic-estate-management/#estate-strategy">estate strategy</a> and <a href="/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/strategic-estate-management/#asset-management-plan">asset management plan</a>.</p>
	

	<p>As part of the process, you should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>be aware of the legal ownership of all land and buildings</li>
	  <li>know what you can and cannot do and what you need approval for</li>
	  <li>define how you can make decisions and get approvals</li>
	  <li>plan for any requirements that have to be met at a specific time</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="dealing-with-acquisitions-and-disposals">Dealing with acquisitions and disposals</h2>
	

	<p>Youâ€™ll need a variety of information when dealing with acquisitions and disposals. This includes:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the process for making and seeking approval for acquisitions and disposals decisions</li>
	  <li>understanding tenure and land ownership implications</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Through strategic estate management, you may identify opportunities to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>acquire new premises and sites</li>
	  <li>dispose of surplus space â€“ both land and buildings</li>
	  <li>grant a third party use of the land and buildings, including for the purposes of generating income</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Acquisitions and disposals may be of freehold, leasehold or other interests. The term â€˜disposalâ€™ often includes the movement or creation of any legal interest in land.</p>
	

	<p>LocatED is a government-owned property company, responsible for buying and developing sites in England to help meet the Governmentâ€™s commitment to build new free schools. If you have land to dispose of, and have already sought and secured the appropriate consents, you may wish to consider <a rel="external" href="https://located.co.uk/">contacting them</a>.</p>
	

	<h3 id="statutory-restrictions">Statutory restrictions</h3>
	

	<p>As well as restrictions on the individual titles of land and requirements imposed by land registration, there are also statutory restrictions imposed on disposing of, or making material changes to, school land.</p>
	

	<p>You may need to seek government approvals for certain land and property transactions and any borrowing, whether or not secured on land, for the purposes of acquiring or developing land.</p>
	

	<p>You should be aware of any protections and the statutory restrictions on the disposal or acquisition of land or buildings. Different types of organisation have to handle disposals differently.</p>
	

	<p>Get advice on <a href="/education/school-buildings-and-land-transactions">land and building transactions</a>.</p>
	

	<h3 id="voluntary-schools">Voluntary schools</h3>
	

	<p>Voluntary-aided and voluntary-controlled schools, and academies that were voluntary schools will generally have their main school buildings on land which is held by trustees of the school on the basis of a trust deed restricting the use of that land.</p>
	

	<p>This includes Church of England or Catholic Church schools. For other schools with a religious character, a religious body or trust may own the land and buildings.</p>
	

	<p>The land may be publicly funded or be charitable land depending on the schoolâ€™s origins and history.</p>
	

	<p>Control of the land and buildings rests with the trustees of the school. Some trustees of the school allow communities to use the land and buildings if it brings income to the school.</p>
	

	<p>Other trust arrangements are more restrictive. Some do not allow third party use of land and buildings, while others will restrict uses to those that support the wider charitable purpose of the trust.</p>
	

	<p>Where the land is publicly-funded land, any disposal of an interest will require notification to the Secretary of State.</p>
	

	<p>Playing field land will usually be land held by the local authority. Schools need to consider the terms of any lease or usage agreement before allowing third parties to use it.</p>
	

	<h3 id="foundation-schools">Foundation schools</h3>
	<p>Most foundation schools hold the freehold of publicly-funded land acquired from the local authority. Any disposal of an interest in the land will require the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>
	

	<p>Some older foundation schools may have land held by trustees of the school which isnâ€™t publicly-funded land. These will have restrictions similar to voluntary schools.</p>
	

	<h3 id="academies">Academies</h3>
	<p>If the academy is on land that is held by way of a lease, for example from the local authority, any use of the land will need to comply with the terms of the lease. This generally requires the freeholderâ€™s formal permission for any use of the land by third parties. The freeholder may need the Secretary of Stateâ€™s consent.</p>
	

	<p>If the academy trust owns the freehold interest, it may still need to seek the Secretary of Stateâ€™s consent to dispose of any interest in publicly-funded land.</p>
	

	<p>If an academy occupies land held by trustees of the school, it is restricted in its use of the land in the same way as voluntary schools are.</p>
	

	<h3 id="community-schools">Community schools</h3>
	<p>Community schools are usually based on land owned by the local authority. They need to follow the local authorityâ€™s policy for using the land. As the freeholder, the local authority may need to apply for consent from the Secretary of State to make any disposal of the land.</p>
	

	<h3 id="publicly-funded-land">Publicly-funded land</h3>
	

	<p>This includes any school land acquired from a local authority or the Secretary of State by a board or trustees of the school. Disposal of any publicly-funded land may require either:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the explicit consent of the Secretary of State</li>
	  <li>prior notification to the Secretary of State who may issue a direction regarding the land</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="seeking-approvals">Seeking approvals</h3>
	

	<p>The approval route will depend on the:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>type of organisation</li>
	  <li>land ownership</li>
	  <li>particular circumstances of the disposal</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The exact definition in law is complicated, so you should get independent professional advice.</p>
	

	<p>You may also have restrictions imposed by any funding agreements you have as well as by the land title itself.</p>
	

	<p>Check you donâ€™t do anything to conflict with the terms of your funding agreement. You can also check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">Academies Financial Handbook</a>.</p>
	

	<h2 id="assessing-the-condition-of-your-estate">Assessing the condition of your estate</h2>
	

	<p>Understanding the condition of the estate will help you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>identify what work is needed to maintain and protect the buildings</li>
	  <li>understand what this will cost</li>
	  <li>prioritise the works</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The best way to understand the current condition of the estate is to commission a condition survey. This provides systematic, uniform and objective information on the state of the buildings.</p>
	

	<p>Condition surveys are technical assessments and should be done by qualified building professionals.</p>
	

	<p>Read more about <a href="/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/maintaining-the-estate#condition-surveys">condition surveys</a> and how to <a href="/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/overseeing-the-estate#procurement">procure professional services</a>.</p>
	

	<h2 id="assessing-the-suitability-and-sufficiency-of-your-estate">Assessing the suitability and sufficiency of your estate</h2>
	

	<p>When youâ€™re planning for the future you need to consider:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>whether the estate meets the needs of pupils, teachers and other users</li>
	  <li>if the estate is the right size for your current and future needs</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Understanding the estateâ€™s suitability and sufficiency will help you make strategic decisions.</p>
	

	<h3 id="completing-a-suitability-assessment">Completing a suitability assessment</h3>
	

	<p>A suitability assessment will help you understand if:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the estate is fit for purpose</li>
	  <li>you need to plan changes to help you improve it</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>There is no prescribed format for a suitability assessment but it should look at teaching and non-teaching areas.</p>
	

	<p>The scope and complexity of the assessment can vary depending on your needs. It should consider:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the size, shape and location of spaces</li>
	  <li>environmental conditions</li>
	  <li>fittings and fixed furniture</li>
	  <li>ICT infrastructure</li>
	  <li>security issues</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Youâ€™ll need to consider stakeholder views in a suitability assessment. For example, some factors will be more important than others to different users. Include input from:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>building managers</li>
	  <li>staff</li>
	  <li>pupils</li>
	  <li>visitors to the building</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should analyse the suitability assessments. For example, you could use a simple scoring system to categorise each building, such as 1 to 5, or a more sophisticated system to include weighting for some more important issues.</p>
	

	<h3 id="completing-a-sufficiency-assessment">Completing a sufficiency assessment</h3>
	

	<p>A sufficiency assessment will help you understand the net capacity of the school. It will show you if you have:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>enough capacity to provide school places</li>
	  <li>potential surplus places</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Youâ€™ll need to understand the number of pupil places available (the capacity) compared to the current and forecast number of pupils.</p>
	

	<p>Youâ€™ll also need to find out the overall areas of school buildings to make sure you have the right number and types of classrooms and support space.</p>
	

	<p>The assessment will help you understand if you need to create more space for school places by:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>extending buildings</li>
	  <li>reconfiguring existing space</li>
	  <li>using modular buildings</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It will also show if you have too much capacity. Holding surplus spaces can have a detrimental effect on the educational offer or financial viability of schools.</p>
	

	<p>If you have too much capacity you could consider:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>rationalising or consolidating buildings across the estate</li>
	  <li>leasing space to third parties</li>
	  <li>reutilising space, for example for childcare provision or community facilities</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should check if there are any <a href="#tenure">restrictions</a> on doing this.</p>
	

	<p>Understanding sufficiency is important for your estate strategy.</p>
	

	<p>This is a complex area. School estate managers will need to engage with school place planning specialists. You may need to contact your local authority or diocesan board.</p>
	

	<p>You can find guidance on space standards in:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mainstream-schools-area-guidelines">Building Bulletin 103: Area guidelines for mainstream schools</a></li>

	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="performance-management-of-your-estate">Performance management of your estate</h2>
	

	<p>You should have an agreed approach to performance management for assets across the estate.</p>
	

	<p>This should include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>a consistent approach to the measurement of property related performance</li>
	  <li>how this information will be used to improve performance</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Performance management of the estate and benchmarking is the measurement and monitoring of property-related performance. This will help you to improve the efficiency of the estate.</p>
	

	<p>Measuring the performance of the estate will help you understand:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>how the property assets in the estate contribute to the overall performance of your organisation</li>
	  <li>how each individual asset in the estate is performing against technical criteria</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Benchmarking is a way of using relative performance to learn from others in an effort to improve. This will include comparison with other organisations or industry standards, and comparison of individual property assets within the estate.</p>
	

	<h3 id="importance-of-performance-management-of-the-estate">Importance of performance management of the estate</h3>
	

	<p>Accountability for financial performance sits at board level. Understanding the performance of the estate and using it to challenge and demonstrate value for money is an important element of accountability.</p>
	

	<p>Performance management of the estate will:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>enable you to monitor and evaluate how property assets are performing to meet the needs of your organisation</li>
	  <li>provide a reference point to support future strategies and value for money decisions</li>
	  <li>provide a mechanism for internal and for external benchmarking</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Benchmarking is not a one off exercise. It can help:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>lock your organisation into a cycle of continuous improvement</li>
	  <li>develop a culture where it is easier to question the norm and make changes</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="who-should-be-responsible">Who should be responsible</h3>
	

	<p>Responsibility for performance management of the estate should sit with an executive leader. They should also be responsible for reporting performance.</p>
	

	<p>They should understand what the executive leadership team and the board want to know about the estate and identify performance measures accordingly. The actual collation and management of the data used to deliver performance reports is likely to be the responsibility of operational staff.</p>
	

	<p>You should use standardised reporting formats where possible to enable better understanding of data needs and performance over time.</p>
	

	<p>The executive leadership team may help identify other benchmarking organisations which may be willing partners.</p>
	

	<p>For schools with a religious character, this should be done in collaboration with the trustees of the school and the diocese.</p>
	

	<h3 id="what-to-consider">What to consider</h3>
	

	<p>You should consider what you want to measure to help you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>manage the estate strategically</li>
	  <li>assess value for money</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Do not make this too complicated. Itâ€™s more important to start the process rather than trying to make it too comprehensive from the start.</p>
	

	<p>You should then make sure:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>you identify appropriate performance criteria so that you can set targets</li>
	  <li>your targets are clearly linked to your strategic goals and the requirements of the trustees of the school</li>
	  <li>you choose measures which are useful to your school and organisation</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You might want to limit this to 5 key measures. Having a small number of useful measures is preferable to having numerous measures that do not provide meaningful information.</p>
	

	<p>Consider any of the following.</p>
	

	<h4 id="financial">Financial</h4>
	

	<p>Running costs â€“ calculation of all property occupancy costs as a total cost per square metre or as a proportion of total school expenditure.</p>
	

	<p>Capital projects â€“ capital cost per square metre or pupil place, proportion of projects delivered to time/cost targets.</p>
	

	<h4 id="condition-and-maintenance">Condition and maintenance</h4>
	

	<p>Condition â€“ categorisation against industry standard condition (A-D) and prioritisation (1-4) categories by percentage of estate in each category.</p>
	

	<p>Maintenance â€“ assessment of maintenance need per square metre, average spend per square metre, by planned to reactive proportion.</p>
	

	<p>Find out more about condition surveys.</p>
	

	<h4 id="space">Space</h4>
	

	<p>Space utilisation â€“ assessment of the utilisation of space by reference to space (square metre) per pupil, the frequency of use and how the space is used.</p>
	

	<p>Find guidelines for:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>mainstream schools</li>
	  <li>SEND and alternative provision</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="environmental-sustainability">Environmental sustainability</h4>
	

	<p>energy consumption â€“ calculation of energy consumption by reference to the area of the building
	environmental impact â€“ assessment of emissions per area of building</p>
	

	<h4 id="risk">Risk</h4>
	

	<p>statutory compliance â€“ measurement of the proportion of the estate which is compliant or non-compliant</p>
	

	<h3 id="track-your-performance">Track your performance</h3>
	

	<p>Once youâ€™ve decided what youâ€™re going to measure you need to identify:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>what data you will need</li>
	  <li>how you can gather the data</li>
	  <li>how you will analyse the data</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Establish a baseline position. Without this, it is not possible to identify any changes in performance.</p>
	

	<p>Use how you perform against targets to define priorities for works and estates activities.</p>
	

	<p>Refine your performance measures over time as your approach to strategic estate management matures, and more data becomes available.</p>
	

	<h3 id="collecting-performance-data">Collecting performance data</h3>
	

	<p>Collecting data can be time consuming and costly. The benefits of identified performance measures must justify the cost and effort of collating, analysing and reporting.</p>
	

	<p>You should assess what data is already collected. You may be able to use this to start with and build on it over time.</p>
	

	<p>Identify performance measures that meet the needs of your organisation. Be realistic about:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>what data can be collected and analysed</li>
	  <li>whether this can be done in a timescale to enable meaningful action</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h3>
	

	<p>Understanding your performance internally is only part of the picture.</p>
	

	<p>Benchmarking with other bodies or organisations can help you identify areas for improvement.</p>
	

	<p>Itâ€™s only through external comparison that it is possible to determine how your organisation is performing in a wider context.</p>
	

	<p>Benchmarking is only a guide. There may be valid reasons why some schools are at the lower or upper extremes of the data range. You should understand the reasons. You may not be in a position at the outset to benchmark externally. Begin once your estate performance management processes are embedded and more data is available.</p>
	

	<p>You may want to identify potential benchmarking groups or partner organisations. You can:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>find out what performance criteria theyâ€™re measuring</li>
	  <li>possibly use some of their findings to set your own targets</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>There may be existing localised, regional or national benchmarking groups.</p>
	

	<p>You could consider contacting peer organisations and discuss the potential to share information for mutual benefit.</p>
	

	<p>You may need the consent of trustees before sharing information.</p>
	

	<p>Some MATs use business intelligence dashboards to support their work.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	EO Consulting has a dashboard that presents all types of condition, compliance and energy usage data so it can be:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>appropriately aggregated</li>
	  <li>used to optimise return on capital investment decisions within estates and organisations</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	

	<p>The Trust Network has case studies which provide further information.</p>
	

	<p>More information and signposting to performance management tools for the estate is available in the information, training and tools section.</p>

	<p>You can use the <a href="/guidance/schools-financial-efficiency-top-10-planning-checks-for-governors">Top 10 checks for boards</a> to help make sure that schools manage their resources efficiently.</p>
	

	<p>You can benchmark some of your property measures against other organisations. In respect of energy, you could use <a href="/government/publications/output-specification-2017-esfa-employers-requirements-part-b">Technical Annex 2H of the Generic Design Brief</a>. It sets out the required technical standards and performance criteria for energy in schools.</p>
