                            <p>Play with your child with things they are interested in. Get down to their level and follow their lead while playing together.</p>
<hr />
<p>Notice what your child is looking or pointing at and talk about it. Try to do this before their attention moves on to something else – that might be within a couple of seconds for babies and toddlers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Picture books introduce your child to new things they haven’t seen yet in real life! For younger children, point to the pictures and say what you see. For older children, ask them to tell the story to you, or talk about what the characters might be thinking and feeling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Take turns to make noises or speak. Even with young babies, you can respond to their babbling by copying back the sounds you hear and then waiting for them to take another turn. Older children can hold longer conversations, so slow down your speech, give them plenty of time to respond and listen carefully to what they have to say.</p>
<hr />
<p>Make reading, singing and playing fun by using lots of actions and, different voices. Young children learn a lot from singing the same song or looking at the same book again and again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Talk to your child in short, simple sentences. This helps them understand what you are saying and makes it easier for them to have a go at copying when they’re ready.</p>

<p>Get some noise-making objects like spoons to bang on saucepans. Watch what your child does then copy it and describe what you are doing using action words like ‘bang bang’ or ‘shake shake’.</p>

<p>Put some everyday items (for example, a toothbrush, an apple, a sock) in a bag and get your baby to find what’s in there. Talk about what they are as your child pulls them out (for example, ‘it’s a toothbrush&#8217;, ‘it’s a sock, for your feet’).</p>

                            <p>At mealtimes, give your child choices, so that they can hear and understand more words. For example, ‘Do you want some grapes or a banana?’ – showing your child the food items at the same time as naming them. Make sure you give them time to answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Say the names of the foods your child is eating and talk about what they’re like, using words like ‘sweet’, ‘sour’, ‘round’, ‘smooth’ ‘cold’, ‘warm’. Pretend to be a rabbit as you bite into a carrot, or a mouse nibbling some cheese. Make sure that both you and your child have some food to try!</p>
<hr />
<p>At bedtime try looking at picture books together. Give your child time to point out things to you. Talk about what they can see using words for actions as well as for things – for example, ‘the baby is sleeping.’</p>

                            <p>Draw simple pictures for your child and encourage them to add marks and colours. Talk about the pictures and colours for example you could draw a house and point to the door and windows.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sprinkle some flour on a table and encourage your child to make marks in the flour with their fingers. Praise their efforts even if it might not look like much to you.</p>
<hr />
<p>Make a puppet out of a sock – all you need is a couple of circles of paper to stick on as eyes. Make the puppet talk to your child or tickle them! Take turns to ‘feed’ the puppet different food items – sometimes they might like them but sometimes they might say ‘yuck’!</p>
<hr />
<p>Make ‘musical instruments’ and sound makers using things you have at home – an empty bottle filled with rice makes a great shaker.</p>

                            <p>Include a favourite toy during daily routines to start developing your child’s pretend play skills. For example, have a favourite teddy or dolly sit next to them at mealtimes and pretend to feed them some toy food. Or, put teddy into bed (which could be a cardboard box) at the same time your little one is going to bed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Combine water play with pretend play by giving dolly a bath. Talk about her body parts while washing her (e.g. ‘wash dolly’s legs, wash dolly’s tummy’). When she’s all clean, dry dolly off and get her dressed again, talking about your actions at the same time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Play repetitive games like pretending to go to sleep and wake up again. Lie down, start ‘snoring’ and encourage your child to ‘wake’ you up. Your child will delight in repeating this game again and again! You can extend the game by adding in a teddy or another toy who falls asleep and you and your child take turns to ‘wake’ them up.</p>

                            <p>Talk about your daily tasks. When you’re making the bed, you could say ‘The bed is messy, let’s tidy the sheets’ Give them simple tasks like putting the pillow at the top of the bed. Praise them for helping.</p>
<hr />
<p>Take photos of what your child does during the day and talk about the pictures. For example, ‘you brushed your hair. You put your coat on’.</p>
<hr />
<p>While waiting in a queue, try sharing picture books together. Talk about the things they can see and how we use them. For example, ‘A chair is something we sit in.’</p>
<hr />
<p>Talk to your child about what has happened so far in the day – for example, ‘we did the washing this morning, didn’t we? We hung all the clothes up to dry.’ And talk about what is going to happen next – ‘After breakfast, we will go to the park.’</p>

                            <p>You could make a photo book of funny, or memorable, family events and talk to your child about what happened and how they felt in these moments.</p>
<hr />
<p>Build on what your child says about what they can see in the photo book – so when they say ‘hat!’ you can say, ‘Yes, it’s a red party hat’.</p>
<hr />
<p>Go on a walk and collect nature objects like leaves. Make a picture from all the things you found and talk about what they are like. What colours did you find? Talk about how the objects feel – are they smooth, bumpy, wet or dry?</p>
<hr />
<p>Playdough is a great way to get creative at home. You can make your own using a simple recipe (do an online search) or use shop-bought playdough. Say words like ‘squish’, ‘roll’, ‘pat’ and ‘poke’ while you do the actions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Make a game of ‘skittles’ out of some empty bottles and a ball. Take turns to roll the ball and see how many skittles you can knock down. Talk about everything as you go, saying things like ‘you knocked down 2 skittles!’.</p>

<hr />
<p>Make a pretend car out of a cardboard box and some felt pens or coloured pencils. You can stick on paper plates for the wheels and a cushion for the seat. As your child pretends to drive the car, talk about what they are doing and where they might be going, saying things like ‘you’re driving so fast’, ‘let’s drive to grandma’s house’.</p>
<hr />
<p>Help your child pretend to be a ‘postman’. You can make a post box out of an old cardboard box with a hole cut in it, and give your child a bag with some envelopes inside it as their letters to post. Talk together about who they might be posting the letters to – you could even draw a picture on each one (for example, ‘this letter is for daddy’, ‘let’s post one to the dog’).</p>
<hr />
<p>Act out stories like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Use soft toys and give your child different sizes of cups and bowls. Chat to them as you are doing actions, for example, ‘let’s give baby bear a cup’.</p>

<p>Play games like, ‘I spy with my little eye something beginning with…’ and say the first sound of the thing that you can see – ‘something beginning with b-b-b-b.’ You can go first and show your child how the game works.</p>

<p>Obstacle courses are great fun and can help your child to listen and learn new words. You can play them inside or outside, just give your child some instructions. Say &#8216;crawl under the blanket&#8217; or &#8216;sit in the box&#8217; or &#8216;jump to the corner&#8217;. Take turns so that they can practice giving the instructions too.</p>
