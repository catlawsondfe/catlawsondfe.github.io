	<p>We need this data for on roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>To minimise the impact of the rollout of universal credit and the introduction of a net-earned income threshold to determine eligibility for free school meals, transitional arrangements have been put in place to ensure that no pupil loses a meal as a result of these changes.</p>
	
	<p>Transitional protections ensure that any pupil in receipt of free school meals on 31 March 2018 or after, should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This covers until at least Summer 2023, and applies even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>You should not enter end dates unless:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a parent has said that they do not wish the child to be recorded as eligible for free school meals and receive a free school meal</li>
	<li>a pupil transfers from another UK country â€“ their non-English free school meals must have an end date</li>
	<li>a parent notifies the school that their support under the Immigration &amp; Asylum Act 1999 or the pension credit has ended</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We use the following 3 data items to collect this information:</p>
	
	<ul>

	</ul>
	
	<p>This field defaults to â€˜Nâ€™ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A â€˜service childâ€™ has parent(s) â€“ or person(s) with exercising parental responsibility â€“ who is/are service personnel serving:</p>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>

	<p>All children become eligible for funded early education from the term following a childâ€™s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged 2 year olds also become eligible from the term following a childâ€™s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some 3 and 4-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week â€“ the extended entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the funded early education entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by us to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that we provide to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by us for funding allocations, funded entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow our statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in â€˜receptionâ€™ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the early years block.</p>

	<p>It is important that the funded entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to 2 decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>

	<p>As with the funded entitlement hours, extended funded entitlement hours become available â€“ where the parent has a valid 30-hour code â€“ from the term following a childâ€™s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age.</p>

	<p>The 30-hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended funded entitlement hours. As with the extended funded entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups â€˜E1â€™, â€˜E2â€™, â€˜N1â€™ and â€˜N2â€™ only, who are on roll on census day. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended funded entitlement hours. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the codeâ€™s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>Foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents do not apply for the extended funded entitlement through the childcare service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Schools will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process.

	<p>Provided that they are taking the 15 hours funded entitlement and meet the eligibility criteria, children become eligible to receive early years pupil premium from the term following a childâ€™s 3rd birthday and retain this entitlement until they move into reception, when they become eligible to receive the â€˜mainstreamâ€™ pupil premium.</p>

	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to Â£1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code â€˜55â€™)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code â€˜56â€™)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year).</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September and then the vulnerable group bursary in the following February. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code â€˜56â€™ and code â€˜55â€™ in the summer school census.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>

	<h2 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h2>
	
	<p>We use the top-up funding indicator to calculate high needs funding allocations. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide bench-marking information to local areas.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, high-needs top-up funding â€“ either from a local authority or, in the case of a <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> / <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>, a local authority or another school. Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained schoolâ€™s budget share or academyâ€™s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will â€“ as with the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision to which it relates â€“ be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code â€˜Kâ€™ â€“ <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, terminology other than high needs top-up funding is used locally. Schools should check with the local authority if they are in doubt about whether payments received from a local authority are high needs top-up funding.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is Â£6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases. Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> / <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>, the funding they receive is Â£10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding.</p>
	
	<p>Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> / <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> usually exceeds Â£10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h2 id="post-looked-after-arrangements-used-for-funding">Post looked after arrangements [used for funding]</h2>
	
	<p>As part of the governmentâ€™s adoption reform programme the department is considering a range of information that will help to inform thinking in relation to post-adoption support. Very little is known about the attainment of children adopted from care because they automatically get a new <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> and the department wants to have better information, collected via this data item on a voluntary basis, to feed into that process.</p>
	
	<p>Post looked after arrangements collects information regarding children, who â€“ on census day â€“ have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. Children who have left care under one of the measures listed above will be eligible for the post looked after element of the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>It is for those with parental responsibility (adoptive parents, special guardians and carers of former looked after children on residence / child arrangements orders) to decide if they wish to self-declare their childrenâ€™s status to schools. Schools should ensure parents and carers are aware of this and that this information is collected to help ensure that the designated teacher for previously looked after children can support those children and the school can attract pupil premium funding to support this cohort. Parents are to provide supporting evidence, for example, a photocopy of the adoption order, and confirm that their child was previously in care in England or Wales.</p>
	
	<p>Parents may conceal sensitive information (for example the name of the birth parents) should they wish.</p>
	
	<p>Schools are reminded that this is particularly sensitive data and of the ongoing need for confidentiality. Schools should ensure that, as for other pupil level data items, they comply with their responsibilities with respect to GDPR when processing this data.</p>
	
	<p>Schools record the information using the following codes. Only one of the values will apply to each pupil and a schoolâ€™s <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> should provide a default value of N â€“ not declared.</p>

	<h3 id="managed-moves">Managed moves</h3>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is on a managed move, the pupil will be dual registered at the original school and the receiving school. The financial arrangements between the schools are a matter for their mutual agreement, but it is important to be able to identify pupils in this situation.</p>
	
	<p>While the pupil is on a managed move:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the original school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Mâ€™ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the receiving school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Sâ€™ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When the pupil has ceased to attend one of the schools, that school will, with the agreement of the other school, delete the pupil from the register.</p>
	
	<h3 id="traveller-pupils">Traveller pupils</h3>
	
	<p>A traveller pupil may attend another school during periods when his / her parent(s) is / are travelling in the course of trade or business. To help ensure continuity of education for traveller children, it is expected that the child should attend school elsewhere when their family is travelling and be dual registered at that school and the school which the pupil would normally attend when not travelling.</p>
	
	<p>While the pupil is attending another school:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the ordinary school of attendance maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Mâ€™ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the receiving school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Sâ€™ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="family-units">Family units</h3>
	
	<p>In many areas, early education is being provided in schools whose proprietors also provide wider childcare and / or family support services. Often, the proprietor wishes to maintain a single management information system for all the children it serves and, equally often, it is the school management information system that is used for this purpose.</p>
	
	<p>When submitting information for census purposes, it is important to distinguish between those children who are receiving early education and those who are receiving other services. For:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>children receiving early education, the school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Câ€™ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	<li>children receiving childcare provision but not early education the school, maintains the childâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Gâ€™ (guest - not a pupil at the school)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="external-candidates">External candidates</h3>
	
	<p>Occasionally, adults are entered in a school <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> for them to enter an examination and, perhaps, receive some level of tuition towards this aim. In such cases the providing school maintains the adultâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Gâ€™ (guest - not a pupil at the school).</p>
	
	<h3 id="approved-educational-activity">Approved educational activity</h3>
	
	<p>Some schools have registered pupils who attend approved educational activity. An approved educational activity is either: an activity that takes place outside the school premises which is of an educational nature, approved by the school and supervised by someone authorised by the school; or attendance at another school at which the pupil is registered (as set out in regulation 6(4) of the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006).</p>
	
	<p>When the pupil is attending an approved activity outside the school premises (not at another school) the pupil should be recorded with an enrolment status of â€˜Câ€™ (current - single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<p>When the pupil is attending another school, they will be dual registered:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the ordinary school of attendance maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Mâ€™ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the other school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Sâ€™ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="dual-registered-pupils---hospital-special-schools">Dual registered pupils - hospital special schools</h3>
	
	<p>Pupils attending a hospital special school are recorded on the register where they are in education. They are not recorded where they attend the hospital for:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>hospital check ups</li>
	<li>day surgery</li>
	<li>any other form of medical appointment</li>
	<li>an operation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is registered at a mainstream school and receives education at the hospital special school, the pupil will be dual registered:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the mainstream school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Mâ€™ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the hospital special school maintains the pupilâ€™s record with an enrolment status of â€˜Sâ€™ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is originally solely registered at the hospital special school and then also begins to attend a mainstream school as part of a reintegration programme, the pupil will be dual registered with the hospital special school holding the â€˜main registrationâ€™ and the mainstream school holding the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-16-overseas-students">Post 16 overseas students</h3>
	
	<p>Some students, who are not citizens of the UK, who are attending state-funded schools and 16 to 19 academies may be eligible to receive public funding. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">funding regulations</a> provide full rules that determine which overseas students can be funded.</p>
	
	<p>No fee can lawfully be levied from the students or anyone else for the studentâ€™s education, as a registered pupil, at a state-funded school or 16 to 19 academy.</p>
	
	<p>For post-16 students, there is a distinction between â€˜overseasâ€™ and â€˜homeâ€™ students:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>overseas students are not eligible to receive public funding</li>
	<li>home students are eligible to receive public funding</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Overseas students are those students who have Tier 4 (student) visas. Such students are not permitted to enter the UK to attend a state-funded school or 16 to 19 academy. They may enter the country to attend a non-maintained special school, independent school or FE provider which is a <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students">registered Tier 4 sponsor</a>.</p>

	
	<p>Post-16 overseas students on census day are recorded with an enrolment status of â€˜Gâ€™ (guest - not a pupil at the school) and not included on the school census returns.</p>
	
	<h2 id="class-type-1">Class type</h2>

	<p>We need this data for on roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>Indicates whether the pupil is in a nursery class or not.</p>
	
	<p>Class equates to registration group. A nursery class is one designated by the local authority â€“ any pupil in a class not designated as a nursery class by the local authority should be counted as an â€˜otherâ€™ (O) class even if they are of nursery age.</p>
	
	<h2 id="pupil-date-of-entry-used-for-funding">Pupil date of entry [used for funding]</h2>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are not removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remains the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained, then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>

	<p>We need this data for off roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>The date the pupil left the current school. This identifies pupils who are no longer on the schoolâ€™s roll.</p>
	
	<p>In the scenario where a pupil does not turn up as expected, schools should be aware that it is unlawful to back date the leaving date. We would expect the school to record the appropriate absence code until such a time they find out the pupilâ€™s whereabouts, once established they can off roll the pupil.</p>
	
	<h2 id="part-time-indicator-used-for-funding">Part-time indicator [used for funding]</h2>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>This indicates whether a pupil is part-time in education. We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time. It does not indicate that a pupil is part-time at one or more establishments.</p>
	
	<p>For children in receipt of funded early education (those following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage), a child should only be recorded as full-time where they attend education for 10 sessions per week irrespective of the number of funded and / or extended childcare hours.</p>
	
	<p>Compulsory school-age pupils on a part-time timetable are recorded as full-time with the appropriate absence code used for the sessions they do not attend.</p>

	<p>This field identifies pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> who are members of a <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit. <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> units are special provisions within a mainstream school where the pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> are taught within separate classes for at least half of their time.</p>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies must only use this indicator where the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<p>Most pupils placed in units will be on an Education, Health and Care plan. It is unlikely that a child would be placed in a unit and also receive support from resourced provision, but a school could have resourced provision for one type of need and a unit for another.</p>

	<p>Resourced provisions are places that are reserved at a mainstream school for pupils with a specific type of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, taught for at least half of their time within mainstream classes, but requiring a base and some specialist facilities around the school.</p>

	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>

	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their â€˜homeâ€™ address as their residence during term time, which may be the schoolâ€™s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>Whilst every effort must be made to obtain these pupil details, if it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors. Address fields should not be used to record notes such as â€˜protected addressâ€™ or any other personal details about the pupil.</p>
	
	<h3 id="postcode-used-for-funding">Postcode [used for funding]</h3>

	<p>A unique property reference number (<abbr title="unique property reference number">UPRN</abbr>) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain. The <abbr title="unique property reference number">UPRN</abbr> is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the <abbr title="unique property reference number">UPRN</abbr> and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: SAON</strong> the secondary addressable object name (SAON), refers to the flat, apartment name, number, or other sub-division of a dwelling.</p>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: PAON</strong> the primary addressable object name (PAON), refers to the dwelling name and / or number.</p>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: street</strong> refers to the street name / description. Validation will result in a query where there is a dwelling name / number but no street. If the address legitimately has no street, the query is ignored.</p>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: locality</strong> refers to a neighbourhood, suburb, district, village, estate, settlement, or parish that may form part of a town, or stands in its own right within the context of an administrative area. Where an industrial estate contains streets, it is defined as a locality in its own right.</p>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: town</strong> refers to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a city or town that is not an administrative area</li>
	<li>a suburb of an administrative area that does not form part of another town</li>
	<li>a London district</li>

	<li>unitary authority</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>BS7666 format: post town</strong> is assigned by the post office, based on the area sorting office.</p>

	<p>From autumn 2020, up to 3 reasons can be recorded for each exclusion (where applicable) with the first collection of this data taking place in spring 2021.</p>
	
	<p>There is no requirement to order the reasons, which will be presented as unweighted counts in statistical outputs.</p>
	
	<p>This table provides examples of reasons for exclusions to aid schools selecting the relevant category. These examples are used as a guide and are not intended to act as a tick list for exclusion. Following the expansion of the categories and the collection of multiple reasons, â€˜otherâ€™ is no longer recorded as a category.</p>
	
	<p>Schools should only select more than one reason where it is appropriate. Where the description is covered in more than one category, please record all reasons that apply, such as â€˜bullyingâ€™ and â€˜racist abuseâ€™ when racist bullying has taken place.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. Only exclusions that have been upheld and the pupil has not been offered reinstatement should be included.</p>
	
	<p>For off roll pupils, we would not normally expect the exclusion start date to be the same as the pupil leaving date.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-excluded-from">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll pupils.</p>
	
	<p>For each fixed period exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dual registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they are attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday â€“ where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupilâ€™s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as â€˜authorised absenceâ€™ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an <abbr title="in-service education and training">INSET</abbr> day. This means the pupilâ€™s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>

	<p>The termly report by all schools on attendance â€“ excluding nursery schools who are not required to submit any attendance data via the school census, even where they have pupils aged 4 or 5 years.</p>
	
	<p>Information for a pupilâ€™s attendance during the term preceding the census is collected termly. This may include information for pupils who left the school prior to census day.</p>
	
	<p>Subject to Parliament, we intend new Regulations to allow the collection of all attendance data, rather than just those that equate to authorised and unauthorised absence.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance data for the 2020 to 2021 academic year will include categories of school attendance, rather than just those that equate to authorised and unauthorised absence. The first collection of this data will occur in spring 2021, which includes data for the previous autumn term.</p>
	
	<p>Information for each census should be included for pupils who were:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>for the autumn 2020 census, aged between 4 and 15 as at 2019-08-31 (where date of birth falls between 2003-09-01 and 2015-08-31)</li>
	<li>for the spring 2021 and summer 2021 censuses, aged 4 to 15 as at 2020-08-31 (where date of birth falls between 2004-09-01 and 2016-08-31)</li>
	<li>on the school roll for at least one session during the specified term</li>

	<p>Schools are not obliged to use individual attendance codes therefore, there are 2 options with regards to how attendance and absence data should be returned.</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>For those schools using an electronic attendance package integrated with their main <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr></strong>, the census extracts the relevant data for each pupil for each attendance period (term or half term). From spring 2021, this will include categories of school attendance, rather than just those that equate to authorised and unauthorised absence.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>For schools not using an integrated attendance package</strong> (or record attendances in paper registers), extract the relevant data for each pupil included in the census, according to the dates for the appropriate attendance period, and manually add this data to the census return. In this case, absence and attendance reporting by reason is not required and schools report on the number of authorised and unauthorised absences for each pupil. From spring 2021, this will also include the total number of sessions attending an approved educational activity and sessions unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances.</p>
	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Schools should seek advice from the supplier of their main <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> on how to add data manually for the census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="dual-registered-pupils">Dual registered pupils</h3>
	
	<p>To avoid the double counting of attendance and absence for pupils who are registered at more than one school (referred to as â€˜dual registeredâ€™).</p>
	
	<p>Each school will:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>record the attendance and absence for the sessions the pupil is required to attend at their school</li>
	<li>use code â€˜Dâ€™ (dual registered at another educational establishment) to record all the sessions that the pupil is due to attend at the other school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Attendance code â€˜Dâ€™ will be collected from spring 2021 in the school census, however it is not counted as part of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>The number of â€˜sessions possibleâ€™ for a dual registered pupil against the main school should exclude those when the pupil is due to attend the subsidiary school and vice versa.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupils-unable-to-attend-school-due-to-exceptional-circumstances--code-y">Pupils unable to attend school due to exceptional circumstances â€“ code â€˜Yâ€™</h3>
	
	<p>Attendance code â€˜Yâ€™ (unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances â€“ not counted in possible attendances) is collected in the school census but is not counted as part of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools will use code â€˜Yâ€™ to record the sessions where a pupil is unable to attend because:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the school site, or part of it, is closed due to an unavoidable cause</li>
	<li>the transport provided by the school or a local authority is not available, and their home is not within walking distance</li>
	<li>a local or national emergency has resulted in widespread disruption to travel, preventing the pupil from attending school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This code can also be used where a pupil is unable to attend because the pupil is in custody and detained for a period of less than 4 months. If the school has evidence from the place of custody that the pupil is attending educational activities then they can record those sessions as code B (present at approved educational activity).</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-possible">Sessions possible</h3>
	
	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<h4 id="zero-sessions-possible">Zero sessions possible</h4>
	
	<p>Zero sessions possible are recorded where a dual registered pupil has all their previous attendance (term or half term) for which attendance data is collected at the other school at which they are registered.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, where a dual registered pupil has all the attendance at his / her subsidiary registration, the main registration would have zero sessions possible recorded for that period in the census.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h4 id="pupils-aged-4-years">Pupils aged 4 years</h4>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, the recorded number of sessions possible are those they are expected to attend and will vary from pupil to pupil and from school to school. Attendance code â€˜Xâ€™ (non-compulsory school age absence - not counted in possible attendances) is used for sessions when a 4-year-old is not expected to attend â€“ for example, those attending part-time.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not required to state whether absence is authorised. If schools do not wish to use the absence codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as â€˜authorisedâ€™ or â€˜unauthorisedâ€™ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unauthorised-absence">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="authorised-absence">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h3 id="approved-activity">Sessions attending an approved educational activity</h3>
	
	<p>An approved educational activity is where a pupil is taking part in supervised educational activity such as field trips, educational visits, work experience or alternative provision. The activity must be of an educational nature approved by the school and supervised by someone authorised by the school. The activity must take place during the session for which the mark is recorded.</p>
	
	<h3 id="exceptional-circumstance">Sessions missed due to an exceptional circumstance</h3>
	
	<p>Exceptional circumstances are where a pupil is unable to attend because of an unavoidable cause, the allowable reasons are detailed in â€˜code Yâ€™</p>
	
	<h3 id="attendance-codes">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h3>
	
	<p>Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as â€˜authorisedâ€™ or â€˜unauthorisedâ€™ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>

	<h3 id="sessions-missed">Number of sessions</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions for each specified attendance or absence reason. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr>, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="summer-half-term">Summer half term</h3>
	
	<p>Study leave should be used sparingly and only granted to year 11 pupils during public examinations. As study leave is unsupervised, schools must record it as an authorised absence. Study leave is no longer applicable once examinations are concluded.</p>
	
	<p>The official school leaving date is the last Friday in June of the school year in which a child reaches age 16. This means that year 11 pupils must remain on the school roll and you must record their attendance to this date.</p>
	
	<p>Where pupils were born on or after 1999-09-01, they must remain in some form of education or training until their 18th birthday.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance data for the second half of the summer term in respect of pupils aged 15 years old are not published in any national statistics.</p>
	
	<h3 id="publication-of-school-absence-data">Publication of school absence data</h3>
	
	<p>It is essential that schools ensure that absence data is returned correctly in the school census, as we publish this data.</p>
	
	<p>Absence data are collected termly at pupil level through the school census and published at national and local authority level through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-pupil-absence">school absence national statistics releases</a>. The underlying absence data, at a school level, is published alongside the absence national statistics.</p>
	
	<p>We do not publish the absence data collected for the sixth half term (second half of the summer term) for 15 year olds (year 11 pupils). This data does not feature as part of the standard measures of attendance statistics.</p>
	
	<p>Information on how pupil absence statistics are produced is available in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/absence-statistics-guide">guide to absence statistics</a>.</p>

	<p>Some schools risk not getting the funding they should because of inaccurate data.</p>
	
	<p>We have produced an <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interactive-post-16-school-census-tool">interactive school census tool</a> aimed at helping institutions return accurate data.</p>
	
	<p>The tool will help schools understand:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>how their data is used to calculate their post-16 funding</li>
	<li>how common data errors affect their funding</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Business managers and staff responsible for preparing and submitting the autumn school census return will find it useful.</p>
	
	<p>The tool is in an Excel workbook; please ensure that <a rel="external" href="https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Enable-or-disable-macros-in-Office-documents-7b4fdd2e-174f-47e2-9611-9efe4f860b12">macros are enabled</a> so that the workbook functions properly.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, there are several <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> post-16 reports available on the COLLECT portal which summarise the post 16 data in your census return to help institutions return accurate data.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>planned learning hours (delivery of qualifications)</li>
	<li>planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours (for all eligible non-qualification activity)</li>
	<li>T Level planned learning hours (delivery of qualifications)</li>
	<li>T Level planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours (for all eligible non-qualification activity)</li>

	<p>Returning no planned hours for a 16 to 19 funded student will negatively impact funding. <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-planned-hours-in-study-programmes">Information on recording planned hours</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>
	
	<p>All planned hours data are collected and returned by the school that holds the studentâ€™s â€˜mainâ€™ registration. Where a student is dual registered, the school with the â€˜mainâ€™ registration makes the return.</p>
	
	<p>We donâ€™t generally expect the planned hours to change, however, there are some circumstances where institutions can amend planned hours, this should be done in the previous year fields.</p>
	
	<h3 id="planned-learning-hours">Planned learning hours [used for funding]</h3>

	<h3 id="planned-employability">Planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students undertaking 16 to 19 study programmes (including T Level transition programmes).</p>
	
	<p>The planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours field records the total planned hours for the student for the current academic year spent on eligible non-qualification activity.</p>

	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students undertaking 16 to 19 study programmes (including T Level transition programmes).</p>
	
	<p>The previous yearâ€™s planned hours are also collected for all post-16 students who were on roll in the previous academic year and in national curriculum year 12 or above, including those who started at the school after the previous autumn census day.</p>
	
	<p>This will allow institutions to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>correct errors in the previous yearâ€™s return</li>
	<li>record information related to the previous year for pupils who started after census day</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li>planned learning hours previous year</li>
	<li>planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours previous year</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For students who were on roll at the time of the previous autumn census, the fields will be automatically populated by your <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> provider using the value recorded in systems from the last autumn census return. For students who have joined since the last census, you must manually add this information.</p>
	
	<p>These fields can be completed or corrected, where appropriate, so previous year data is complete and accurate.</p>
	
	<p>Planned hours data should not be changed to reflect actual hours, except in very limited circumstances.</p>
	
	<p>Please see the â€˜changes to planned hoursâ€™ section in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">rates and formula guidance</a> for further information on the circumstances where we expect planned hours to be amended.</p>
	
	<h3 id="T-level-planned-learning-hours">T Level planned learning hours and planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>From autumn 2020 T Level planned hours must be returned for all students undertaking T Level programmes. As T Levels are 2 year programmes, the value should cover the whole programme, and will, in all but a few exceptional circumstances cover multiple years. This differs from planned qualification hours and non-qualification hours, for study programmes which are recorded annually for each student.</p>
	
	<p>Where a student is only undertaking a T Level programme in the year, you should only return T Level planned learning hours and T Level planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours.</p>
	
	<p>Where a student is only undertaking a study programme or a T Level transition 
	programme you should only return planned learning hours and planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours.</p>
	
	<p>The only scenarios we envisage where a student should have both sets of planned hours recorded in the same academic year is where a student undertakes a short T Level transition programme progressing onto a T Level programme in the same year or transfers from a T Level programme to a study programme in-year.</p>
	
	<p>T Level planned hours must include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the technical qualification</li>
	<li>specialist content</li>
	<li>non-qualification activity</li>

	<p>Students must study maths and/or English as part of their programme in each academic year where they do not hold a grade 4/C or above in each subject. This applies to students:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>aged 16 to 18 and 19 to 24 with an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plan who do not hold a GCSE grade 9 to 4, A* to C (a standard pass grade) or equivalent qualification in these subjects</li>
	<li>doing a programme of 150 hours or more, which started on or after 1 August 2014</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Maths and/or English study is a condition of funding. We will remove funding for students who do not meet the condition.</p>

	<p>Schools must only include post-16 data, including learning aims for those students who have (or had at the time of the learning aims) current or main registration at the school. For dual registered students, funding is allocated to the main school. All post-16 data including learning aims for dual registered students must be returned by the school that holds the studentâ€™s main registration (the main school returns the learning aims being taken at both the main and subsidiary schools).

	<p>A re-sit occurs when an examination is taken again but the student does not attend regular lessons for the course (attendance at revision classes may occur). Information in relation to re-sits is not required for the purposes of this collection and therefore must not be returned by schools.</p>
	
	<p>A re-take occurs when a student is retaking a complete qualification or part of a modular qualification, including attendance at regular classes, and this will be treated in the same manner as any other course and recorded as a new learning aim.</p>

	<p>Where students move between year groups during an academic year, it may not be possible for a schoolâ€™s <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> to automatically identify the appropriate students or learning aims that need to be included in the school census return. In such cases, advice should be sought from the software provider and the school may need to make its own judgements according to the criteria set out above to decide whether the student and the learning aims should be included in the school census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="processes-for-recording-learning-aims-used-for-funding">Processes for recording learning aims [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<h4 id="prior-to-or-at-the-start-of-the-academic-year">Prior to or at the start of the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>Before recording details of learning aims for individual students, we recommend that schools produce a list of the qualifications that they will be providing. This school list will then be used for allocating specific learning aims to students. This list should only contain qualifications that are valid for the academic year in question (qualification validity dates are shown in <abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr> and <abbr title="Learning Aims Reference Service">LARS</abbr>) as invalid qualifications can result in negative impacts on your 16 to 19 funding.</p>
	
	<p>Each qualification in the school list is identified by:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a qualification number (<abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr>)</li>
	<li>a subject classification code (<abbr title="subject classification code">SCC</abbr>)</li>
	<li>a learning aim start date (the date the learning activities for the qualification will start for each student â€“ students may have differing start dates for the same learning aim)</li>
	<li>a learning aim planned end date (the date the learning activities for the qualification are planned to end for each student â€“ students may have differing end dates for the same learning aim)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>â€˜Learning activitiesâ€™ includes any examination or other method of assessment.</p>
	
	<p>Schools will need to use the <a rel="external" href="https://collectdata.education.gov.uk/qwsweb/(S(bb4rppbei4ilcm45hm12wi3y))/default.aspx"><abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> Web Services website (<abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr>)</a> to identify the correct <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> and <abbr title="subject classification code">SCC</abbr> for each learning aim.</p>
	
	<p>QNs are available for the overall International Baccalaureate (<abbr title="International Baccalaureate">IB</abbr>) and for each component (subject) qualification. When students take the full <abbr title="International Baccalaureate">IB</abbr>, schools must record the <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> for the whole qualification, and not the QNs for the individual components. When students are only taking components of the <abbr title="International Baccalaureate">IB</abbr>, but not the whole qualification, schools must return the QNs for those components.</p>
	
	<p>The <abbr title="International Baccalaureate">IB</abbr> Organisation also offer the International Baccalaureate career-related certificate. This can include components from other awarding organisations. Schools return the overall <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr>, along with the QNs for components offered by non-<abbr title="International Baccalaureate">IB</abbr> awarding organisations.</p>
	
	<h4 id="at-the-start-of-the-academic-year">At the start of the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>At the beginning of the academic year, schools enter details for each learning aim undertaken by a student, using the school list described above. This includes those courses starting in the current and those continuing from the previous academic year(s).</p>
	
	<p>Schools identify and record the core learning aim (the principal or most important qualification) for students undertaking a vocational study programme. There is one core aim per student, per academic year. There is more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">core aim</a> on GOV.UK and in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<h4 id="throughout-the-academic-year">Throughout the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>Throughout the academic year, schools update the actual end date and status of the learning aim as appropriate.</p>
	
	<p>When the learning aim status is continuing (the default value), the learning aim actual end date is left blank. When the student has completed, withdrawn or transferred from the learning aim, the learning aim actual end date reflects the date the status changed.</p>
	
	<h4 id="for-the-autumn-school-census">For the autumn school census</h4>
	
	<p>Schools must ensure that records are up to date and include all learning aims in scope.</p>
	
	<p>Performance measures for all qualifications are calculated according to the planned end date. Where a student continues their study beyond the planned end date entered at the start of the learning aim, schools must not change the planned end date.</p>
	
	<h3 id="learning-aims-submitted-in-error">Learning aims submitted in error</h3>
	
	<p>Any learning aims that were active at any point during the current or previous academic year â€“ that have been submitted in error during a previous census must not be returned in the current census.</p>
	
	<p>In such situations, schools are required to keep their local management information system up to date with the correct learning aims information with only the correct learning aims being returned in the next census. See example below for further details.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example â€˜Aâ€™: correcting the recording of an incorrect learning aim in a previous census</strong></p>
	
	<p>During the 2019 autumn school census, the following learning aim was submitted as being undertaken during the 2019 to 2020 academic year:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>qualification number equals Z9999999</li>
	<li>subject classification code equals 1234</li>
	<li>learning aim start date equals 2019-09-01</li>
	<li>learning aim planned end date equals 2020-07-31</li>
	<li>learning aim actual end date equals NULL (as aim not completed as at 2018 autumn census)</li>
	<li>learning aim status equals â€˜1â€™ - the learner is continuing or intending to continue the learning activities leading to the learning aim</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Following completion of the 2019 autumn census, the school subsequently discovered that they recorded the incorrect subject classification code for this learning aim â€“ this should be 4321 rather than 1234.</p>
	
	<p>To correct this error the school must update the learning aim in their system with the correct details (either by amending the existing aim or by deleting the incorrect aim and creating a new one) and only the correct aim must be returned in the following census.</p>
	
	<p>In this example, the correct aim was completed on 2020-07-31 and therefore the following information would be returned in the 2020 autumn census:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>qualification number equals Z9999999</li>
	<li>subject classification code equals 4321</li>
	<li>learning aim start date equals 2019-09-01</li>
	<li>learning aim planned end date equals 2020-07-31</li>
	<li>learning aim actual end date equals 2020-07-31</li>
	<li>learning aim status equals â€˜2â€™ - the learner has completed the learning activities leading to the learning aim</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example â€˜Bâ€™: correcting the recording of a learning aim that was never started by the student</strong></p>
	
	<p>During the 2019 autumn school census, the following learning aim was submitted as being undertaken during the 2019 to 2020 academic year:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>qualification number equals Z9999999</li>
	<li>subject classification code equals 1234</li>
	<li>learning aim start date equals 2019-09-01</li>
	<li>learning aim planned end date equals 2020-07-31</li>
	<li>learning aim actual end date equals NULL (as aim not completed as at 2019 autumn census)</li>
	<li>learning aim status equals â€˜1â€™ - the learner is continuing or intending to continue the learning activities leading to the learning aim</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Following completion of the 2019 autumn census, the school subsequently discovered that they incorrectly recorded the learning aim, as the student did not start the course.</p>
	
	<p>To correct this error the school must delete the learning aim in their system and ensure that only the correct aims are returned in the following census.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>As the autumn census drives funding it is important that this amendment is made before the final submission of the autumn return. Failing to correct this error may also affect the schoolâ€™s retention measures.</p>
	
	<h3 id="qualification-numbers-and-subject-classification-codes-used-for-funding">Qualification numbers and subject classification codes [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>Every course leading to a qualification that is funded for schools in England has a qualification number (<abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr>) and subject classification code (<abbr title="subject classification code">SCC</abbr>).</p>
	
	<p>You can find a list of QNs (with associated data) on the <a rel="external" href="https://collectdata.education.gov.uk/qwsweb/(S(bb4rppbei4ilcm45hm12wi3y))/default.aspx"><abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> Web Services (<abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr>) website</a>. Schools must only return valid qualification numbers and should check they have the latest version downloaded to their <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr>.</p>
	
	<p>SCCs identify pathways within a qualification. Some qualifications use different discount codes / subject classification codes for <abbr title="key stage 4">KS4</abbr> and for post-16. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2018-performance-tables-discount-codes">discount codes</a> on GOV.UK will show the <abbr title="key stage 4">KS4</abbr> code and the post-16 code. This may be useful if your <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> is trying to match awarding organisation data to learning aims data.</p>
	
	<p>If this causes you any difficulty, you should contact your software supplier. They should be able to advise on the best course of action. If in doubt, use the <abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr> discount code.</p>
	
	<h4 id="qn-validity">
	<abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> validity</h4>
	
	<p>Qualifications are available for a limited period. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-96-qualifications"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> list of qualifications approved for funding 14 to 19</a> is a downloadable list of qualifications that the Secretary of State for Education has approved for teaching to young people. Each qualification has an approval start date and an approval end date listed, along with the certification end date set by the awarding organisation.</p>
	
	<p><abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr> also lists approval start and end dates. Students must not start on any course after the approval end date has passed, unless they are re-sitting the course. For re-sits, the final assessment or examination must be taken before the certification end date.</p>
	
	<p>When schools want to use a <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> that has an approval end date in the near future, they must check with awarding organisations to find out whether the qualification is being extended or replaced.</p>
	
	<p>Some qualifications are approved on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-96-qualifications"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> list of qualifications approved for funding 14 to 19</a> but are not eligible for 16 to 19 funding.

	<h3 id="programme-aim">Programme aim [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for on roll students.</p>
	
	<p>From autumn 2020 there will be 3 types of 16 to 19 programme:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>study programme (including traineeships)</li>
	<li>T Level transition programme (for those students who will move on to a T Level but need targeted support to prepare them for T Level study)</li>
	<li>T Level</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>With multiple types of programme available to students it is important to be able to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>identify the type of programme a student is undertaking</li>
	<li>record programme level information for each student and</li>
	<li>link component learning aims to a programme</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This is particularly important where a student undertakes more than one type of programme in 1 year.</p>
	
	<p>From autumn 2020 all on roll pupils undertaking 16 to 19 programmes must have a programme aim recorded alongside the component learning aims.</p>
	
	<p>The programme aim is ZPROG001 and is used for all 3 programme types. The programme type field below identifies the type of programme undertaken.</p>
	
	<p>The programme aim captures information about the whole programme. Therefore the start and end dates reflect the overall programme duration, and the completion status reflects whether all the components in that programme were completed or not.</p>

	<p>From autumn 2020, the census now records a programme type against all learning aims. The programme type indicates what type of programme each learning aim belongs to.</p>
	
	<p>A student undertaking one type of programme should have only 1 programme type recorded against all learning aims whereas a student undertaking 2 different programmes will have more than one programme type, each recorded against the learning aims that belong to the different programmes.</p>
	
	<p>The programme type code indicates whether a student is studying:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a T Level transition programme (code 30)</li>
	<li>a T Level (code 31)</li>
	<li>another 16 to 19 study programme (code 01)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The programme type will default to code 01 â€“ allowing those institutions delivering T Level or T Level transition programmes to amend locally.</p>
	
	<h3 id="core-aim-used-for-funding">Core aim [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>In this field, we need the core aim within a vocational 16 to 19 funded study programme only. If a student follows an academic programme, schools must not record a core aim.</p>
	
	<p>More information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-core-aims-in-study-programmes">choosing a core aim</a> is available on GOV.UK and in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="sub-contracting-partner-ukprn">Sub-contracting partner <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr>
	</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>The sub-contracting partner <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr> is recorded for all learning aims that are sub-contracted to a third-party organisation where the education provision will be paid for with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> 16 to 19 funding through a contractual arrangement.</p>
	
	<p>Schools must record the UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr>) against the learning aim(s) that are sub-contracted to the partner organisation.</p>
	
	<h3 id="learning-aim-withdrawal-reason">Learning aim withdrawal reason</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>You should select the reason that most closely matches the reason for the student leaving the course. You can only select one reason.</p>
	
	<p>Find a <a rel="external" href="https://catlawsondfe.github.io/census-codes#withdrawal-reason">withdrawal reason code</a>.</p>

	
	<p>Unless a student has withdrawn from the learning aim prior to census day, the learning aim withdrawal reason is left blank.</p>
	
	<h3 id="traineeships-used-for-funding">Traineeships [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>Traineeships are programmes that prepare young people for employment so that they are able to progress successfully to apprenticeships or other sustainable jobs. If a traineeship programme includes work experience that must be the core aim. Further guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delivering-traineeships-through-efa-funding">traineeships</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

	
	<p>The traineeship indicator is set against each of the studentâ€™s learning aims. The default is set to â€˜falseâ€™ (or â€˜0â€™), and any learning aim that is part of a traineeship programme is recorded as â€˜trueâ€™ (or â€˜1â€™).</p>
	
	<p>Where learning aims from a previous academic year contribute to a traineeship, you do not need to flag them retrospectively.</p>
	
	<h3 id="work-placement">Work placement entity [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We need this data for both on and off roll students.</p>
	
	<p>The school census records work experience and industry placements using a <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> for one of the following:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>T Level industry placement: ZWRKX003</li>
	<li>industry placement, capacity and delivery fund (CDF): ZWRKX002</li>
	<li>16 to 19 study programme work experience: ZWRKX001</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>A work experience / industry placement <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> can have more than one work placement entity. This means that students who have more than one placement, possibly with more than one employer, will have one <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> and multiple work placement entities.</p>
	
	<p>For each work experience / industry placement, the following fields should be recorded:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the start and end dates for each episode of a placement</li>
	<li>the planned work placement hours for each episode of a placement</li>
	<li>the employer (using the employer reference number (ERN) from the <a rel="external" href="https://edrs.education.gov.uk/search/lsc/find.aspx">employer data service</a>)</li>
	<li>whether the placement is internal or external</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="recording-a-levels">Recording A levels</h3>
	
	<p>Linear A-levels were introduced in August 2015 for a number of subject areas. The AS is decoupled from the A-level, which means that AS marks will not count towards the A-level. Learners do not need to enter for an AS level in order to pursue a subject to A-level. More information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gcse-as-and-a-level-reforms">reformed A-levels</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

	
	<p>With linear qualifications, schools can choose between 3 approaches.</p>
	
	<p>A learner studying for an A-level who does not intend to sit the AS-level: the school records the A-level for the first year with a learning aim planned end date reflecting the planned 2-year length of the course. For example, for a student starting an A-level in September 2020 the start date will be 2020-09-01 and the planned end date will be 2022-07-31.</p>
	
	<p>A learner planning to take the AS-level as well as for the A-level: the school records the AS-level for the first year with a learning aim planned end date reflecting the planned one-year length of the course. For example, for a student starting an AS-level in September 2020 the start date will be 2020-09-01 and the planned end date will be 2021-07-31. When the learner goes on to the A-level in 2021, the school must record the A-level as a one-year course (the start date will be 2021-09-01 and the planned end date will be 2022-07-31).</p>
	
	<p>A learner who is only planning to complete the AS-level: the school records the AS-level with a start date of 2020-09-01 and a planned end date of 2021-07-31. If the learner decides to go on to do the A-level as well, the A-level must be recorded in 2021, as in the scenario above.</p>
	
	<p>In all cases, providers must accurately record the learning aim that a learner is working towards.</p>
	
	<p>There is no funding implication. 16 to 19 funding is based on the planned hours for the studentâ€™s programme each year. As long as the planned hours accurately record the studentâ€™s planned activity, the funding will be correct.</p>
	
	<h4 id="transfers-and-withdrawals">Transfers and withdrawals</h4>
	
	<p>Where a learner changes the AS or A-level learning aim that they are working towards, or withdraws from the learning aim, this must be recorded in the usual way on the school census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="new-qn-codes-for-t-level-and-t-level-transition-programmes">New <abbr title="qualification number">QN</abbr> codes for T Level and T Level transition programmes</h3>
	
	<p><strong>For information only</strong></p>
	
	<p>Each of the 25 T Levels are assigned a new regulated technical qualification. These are recorded on the Ofqual register, approved on the <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> List of Qualifications approved for funding 14-19 and listed in <abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr>.</p>
	
	<p>Every T Level programme must have a T Level qualification recorded.</p>
	
	<p>The T Level qualification is split between core content (which is common activity for all students undertaking the T Level) and occupational specialist content (which will differ from student to student depending on the area(s) they have chosen to specialise in).</p>
	
	<p>Whilst the overall T Level qualification will be a regulated qualification the individual occupational specialisms wonâ€™t. However, identifying these for each T Level student is important as, in some cases, they will determine how much funding a T Level student receives. Therefore, <abbr title="QAN web services">QWS</abbr> will hold QNs for every occupational specialism assigned to each T Level.</p>
	
	<p>Every T Level programme must also have at least one occupational specialism related to the T Level recorded.</p>
	
	<p>T Level transition programmes must be linked to the T Level the student plans to progress to. In order to record this link 11 new learning aims will be available to be recorded in each transition programme that will identify the appropriate T level route.</p>
