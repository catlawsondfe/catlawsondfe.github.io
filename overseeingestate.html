	<p>Having a strategic approach with the right plans and documents in place will make sure the estate supports your education needs and goals.</p>
	

	<p>An estate includes land and buildings. Strategic estate management is what you do to make sure it supports your education needs and goals.</p>
	

	<p>It’s most effective when:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>it involves the whole organisation</li>
	  <li>it’s coordinated and integrated with your business planning processes</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You may also have obligations for the upkeep and maintenance of the estate to accord with the requirements of your basis of occupation.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	Schools supported by a charitable foundation must meet the foundation’s objectives. This includes schools with a religious character. The objectives could be reflected in the:
	* trust deed
	* articles of association in an academy
	* Instrument of Government in a maintained school</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>To support the strategic management of the estate you should have the following documents:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>estate vision</li>
	  <li>estate strategy</li>
	  <li>asset management plan</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>As a minimum, you should have shared and agreed these documents with your board.</p>
	

	<p>You can manage the estate strategically whatever your organistion type or size of the estate. This includes single stand-alone schools, multi-academy trusts (MATs), local authorities and schools with a religious character.</p>
	

	<p>Strategic estate management will help you to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>make decisions supported by evidence</li>
	  <li>use your resources efficiently</li>
	  <li>maximise the estate’s value</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Many factors will influence how you manage the estate, including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the size, location, ages and types of buildings and land in the estate</li>
	  <li>what information you hold about the estate</li>
	  <li>the maturity of your organisation and your experience in estate matters</li>
	  <li>land tenure and constraints</li>
	  <li>area based considerations of the need for places/spare capacity in the system</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>How you manage the estate will vary to reflect these differences and how you are governed.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	In a larger MAT, you need to take a strategic and long-term view of investment and expenditure across the whole estate. However, each school is different so you should also allow for local autonomy in the way the strategy is delivered.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>Any investment in the estate should be based on evidence that it addresses an educational need. This will make sure that all decisions are informed, transparent and consistent.</p>
	

	<p>You should plan and coordinate all estate related activities. These should form part of your asset management plan based on an analysis of need and data to make sure that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>all works and projects are prioritised to meet your safety, educational and other goals</li>
	  <li>funding sources, budget availability and constraints are recognised</li>
	  <li>opportunities for capital and revenue savings are maximised</li>
	  <li>you minimise disruption to your school operation</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="benefits-of-managing-your-estate-strategically">Benefits of managing your estate strategically</h3>
	

	<p>Good strategic estate management can deliver both financial and non-financial benefits. It will help your school to be:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>safe - poorly maintained schools are likely to be more hazardous</li>
	  <li>successful - well-designed facilities can be linked to levels of attainment</li>
	  <li>financially sustainable - an effectively managed estate will minimise surplus space and revenue costs, optimise revenue generation, prioritise investment and maintain asset value</li>
	  <li>efficient - planned repairs and maintenance can minimise emergency works, prevent failures and loss of facilities, and save money</li>
	  <li>appealing – a well-maintained school will help create a positive impression, and attract pupils and staff</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Poor estate management can lead to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>inefficient use of resources and poor investment decisions</li>
	  <li>buildings not being maintained</li>
	  <li>risks to the safety of building users</li>
	  <li>teaching areas being taken out of service</li>
	  <li>disruption to the day-to-day running of your school</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It can also affect morale, staff retention, recruitment and pupil numbers.</p>
	

	<h3 id="how-to-manage-your-estate-strategically">How to manage your estate strategically</h3>
	

	<p>Your strategic management of the estate should be linked to your school’s business planning.</p>
	

	<p>To manage the estate strategically you should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>understand what you need to do with the estate to meet your educational (or other) goals</li>
	  <li>set up good governance arrangements</li>
	  <li>assign responsibilities across the estate</li>
	  <li>agree an implementation plan</li>
	  <li>review and track your performance</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="meeting-educational-goals">Meeting educational goals</h3>
	

	<p>You should understand how the estate can support your educational goals and vision. This will make sure you are aware of:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>any shortfalls or surplus provision in your schools and in the wider area - assessed through an evidence-based identification of need</li>
	  <li>what you need to spend on the estate to meet your needs - reflecting an assessment of condition and what is needed to make it safe</li>
	  <li>what changes you need to make to the estate, and when – reflecting an assessment of any works required and how these need to be prioritised</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Schools with a religious character and those supported by a charitable foundation must make sure that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the goals of the school meet the requirements of their foundation</li>
	  <li>they meet their obligations to the trustees of the school, in relation to the maintenance and upkeep of the land and buildings</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="governance-arrangements">Governance arrangements</h2>
	

	<p>You should have good governance arrangements in place. These will make sure that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the estate is recognised and managed as a strategic resource</li>
	  <li>there’s board and executive leader responsibility for the estate</li>
	  <li>all estate related roles and responsibilities are defined and understood</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The estate is an important resource. It should be specifically recognised in governance arrangements.</p>
	

	<p>The purpose of governance in estate management is to provide:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>strategic leadership</li>
	  <li>robust accountability for estates issues</li>
	  <li>oversight and assurance for educational and financial performance</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It will help you make good and consistent decisions.</p>
	

	<p>There may be specific additional governance expectations or arrangements put in place for particular organisations, such as diocesan authorities, academy sponsors or MATs.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	The board of a Catholic school (including academies) occupies and conducts the school on behalf of the trustees of the school, under the supervision of the diocesan bishop. Ultimately, any decisions relating to the land and buildings rest with the trustees of the school, unless this has been delegated to the board/academy trust by the trustees.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>A MAT board will be responsible and accountable for all the academies within the trust, but it could delegate some decisions to local governing bodies or other committees.</p>
	

	<p>In a maintained school, boards and local authorities are required to have regard to statutory guidance on the discharge of their functions.</p>
	

	<p>Review the top 10 estate checks for boards about estate management.</p>
	

	<p>Further details about the core role, function and duties of governance are set out in the Department for Education’s (DfE’s): Governance handbook for academies, multi-academy trusts and maintained schools.</p>
	

	<p>DfE’s guidance on multi-academy trust good practice and expectations for growth gives guidance on developing a successful trust, including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>advice on school governance and leadership</li>
	  <li>helping schools improve</li>
	  <li>financial sustainability and risk management</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="importance-of-good-governance">Importance of good governance</h3>
	

	<p>Strategic estate management is not just an activity for property professionals. It should be:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>led by the board with support from executive leaders and school business professionals to develop understanding of estate issues</li>
	  <li>integrated with your other business and financial planning processes</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Everyone has a role to play. Recognising estates in your governance arrangements will make sure that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>everyone is aware of their role and responsibilities</li>
	  <li>executive leaders are responsible for the estate</li>
	  <li>decisions reflect your visions and priorities</li>
	  <li>there’s appropriate challenge and transparency</li>
	  <li>property budgets are effectively managed</li>
	  <li>property services are coordinated to achieve value for money</li>
	  <li>the risks associated with the use and occupation of land and buildings are minimised</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Without good estates governance, clear responsibilities and good communication there’s a risk that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>there is no accountability for the estate at board or executive leader level</li>
	  <li>property decision-making can become fragmented</li>
	  <li>operational activities can become uncoordinated</li>
	  <li>inefficiencies and poor investment decisions are made</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="role-of-governing-boards">Role of governing boards</h3>
	

	<p>The board is accountable for the performance of your organisation. As a governor or charity trustee, your role is to make sure that your organisation is being managed properly.</p>
	

	<p>The board should ensure that it maintains oversight of the estate. This could be considered regularly in-depth by a relevant committee and in turn reported to the full board. You may find it helpful to designate a board member to have specific responsibility for the estate.</p>
	

	<p>Your board should challenge your executive leaders to make sure they are:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>keeping the estate safe and secure for everyone</li>
	  <li>aware of what investment is needed in the estate</li>
	  <li>planning for longer term needs as well as the short term</li>
	  <li>allocating resources in line with strategic priorities</li>
	  <li>making best use of available budgets</li>
	  <li>using land and buildings efficiently and driving value from the estate</li>
	  <li>getting best value through procurement</li>
	  <li>looking for opportunities to work with others to be more efficient</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You need to ask the right questions. You can use the top 10 estate checks for boards to help you challenge your executive leaders and drive efficiencies from the estate.</p>
	

	<h3 id="your-governance-arrangements">Your governance arrangements</h3>
	

	<p>Your governance arrangements should cover the whole estate management function. This should include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>strategic functions – making sure that all decisions reflect the overall vision, priorities and financial sustainability</li>
	  <li>operational functions - making sure that property services are coordinated to give value for money, that budgets are well managed and risks are minimised</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>This applies regardless of:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the type of your organisation</li>
	  <li>the size of your organisation</li>
	  <li>how many properties make up the estate</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Make sure it is clear who is responsible for what at a board and executive leadership level. This should state which governance functions are retained at board level and which are delegated.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	A large multi-academy trust (MAT) may have both centralised and localised governance arrangements although the MAT remains accountable.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>A school supported by a charitable trust (including schools with a religious character) will have governance arrangements reflecting the requirements of the trust deed.</p>
	

	<p>A maintained school may have governance arrangements involving the local authority.</p>
	

	<p>You should make sure there is clear separation between strategic non-executive oversight and operational executive leadership.</p>
	

	<p>Some operational activities may be delegated to a local level. However legal duties placed on a board will remain with them, even if certain functions or responsibilities are delegated. You should document all delegations, making sure they are appropriately communicated and that accountability is clear.</p>
	

	<h3 id="document-your-governance-arrangements">Document your governance arrangements</h3>
	

	<p>You should document your governance arrangements. Doing this will:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>make sure everyone knows what the estate-related governance arrangements are</li>
	  <li>make sure your arrangements are known across the whole organisation</li>
	  <li>set out important roles and responsibilities for strategic and operational estate management</li>
	  <li>set out what estate specific performance measures are being used</li>
	  <li>show how performance will be reported and who is responsible for this</li>
	  <li>identify strategic property policies</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should make sure that your governance arrangements are referred to and reflected in your asset management plan (AMP).</p>
	

	<p>Find out more about what should be in your AMP.</p>
	

	<h3 id="sharing-your-arrangements">Sharing your arrangements</h3>
	

	<p>You should share your arrangements within and outside your organisation.</p>
	

	<p>How your governance arrangements are shared and communicated will vary depending on their complexity and the size of your organisation.</p>
	

	<p>Good communication at all levels is essential to make sure everyone understands:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the arrangements</li>
	  <li>roles and responsibilities</li>
	  <li>reporting lines</li>
	  <li>working practices</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>This applies at an organisational and individual site level.</p>
	

	<p>As well as the governance arrangements, you should share your school’s estate vision and strategy.</p>
	

	<p>Share your AMP with everyone involved in, or affected by, operational estate management.</p>
	

	<p>Consider how you’ll share:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>any changes to your arrangements or strategic documents with existing staff</li>
	  <li>your arrangements with new staff</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You may also choose to share some parts with other stakeholders. This could include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>other schools</li>
	  <li>potential partners</li>
	  <li>your local community</li>
	  <li>parents and carers</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="skills-and-knowledge">Skills and knowledge</h4>
	<p>You will need a range of skills and knowledge within the board and organisation as a whole.</p>
	

	<h4 id="governing-boards">Governing boards</h4>
	<p>Boards should include a range of skills, as set out in the governance handbook and competency framework.</p>
	

	<p>For estates specifically, the required knowledge and skills tool sets out what is needed within organisations.</p>
	

	<p>Boards should consider their role and the skills they require as part of this.</p>
	

	<h3 id="organisational-capability">Organisational capability</h3>
	

	<p>Managing the estate involves many strategic, operational and technical roles. If you do not already have the knowledge in your organisation to cover these roles you may consider:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>training and supporting current staff to cover routine roles</li>
	  <li>employing external professionals</li>
	  <li>sharing skills and resources with other schools</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>When engaging professional support follow the appropriate procurement processes.</p>
	

	<p>Find out more about how to procure professional services.</p>
	

	<p>The required knowledge and skills tool may also help boards to assess whether schools have the estate expertise required. However, the tool is not aimed at school business professionals.</p>
	

	<p>Their skills are set out in ISBLs professional framework.</p>
	

	<p>More information and resources about governance are available in the Information, training and tools section of this manual.</p>
	

	<h2 id="assigning-responsibilities">Assigning responsibilities</h2>
	

	<p>You should be clear about who is involved in the strategic planning process in your organisation. You should define the accountabilities, responsibilities and roles at the different levels.</p>
	

	<p>You could list the different estates activities, then set out where responsibility sits across the different levels of hierarchy in your organisation for each activity. This could include the need to obtain consents within the organisation in the decision-making process.</p>
	

	<p>The hierarchy will depend on your organisation type. This could include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>charity trustees</li>
	  <li>trustees of the school</li>
	  <li>executive leaders</li>
	  <li>local governing board</li>
	  <li>head teacher/principal</li>
	  <li>local authority</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You could define responsibility in different ways. Consider using terms such as:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>accountable – those who would be ultimately answerable if the task was not completed correctly or thoroughly. They would be the ones who would delegate the work to those who would be responsible</li>
	  <li>responsible – those who would be responsible for the task and ensuring that it’s done</li>
	  <li>support – those who would provide the resource to those responsible to help complete the task</li>
	  <li>consulted – those who would provide input and an opinion, and be engaged in the process</li>
	  <li>informed – those who would be kept up to date with the progress of the task</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="reviewing-and-tracking-performance">Reviewing and tracking performance</h2>
	

	<p>You should review and track the performance of the estate. Doing this will make sure that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>executive leaders recognise the importance of measuring the performance of the estate – for example, knowing * what the estate costs to run, what condition it is in and how much needs to be spent to make it safe</li>
	  <li>implications of poor performance are recognised – for example, knowing that you are spending more than you * need to, that you have more space than you need and could use it more efficiently, or that there is a safety risk to users</li>
	  <li>options for improvement are considered – for example, whether to refurbish an existing building or build a new one, whether to repair or replace a boiler, or whether to rationalise the estate</li>
	  <li>you get value for money from any expenditure on the estate - for example, by changing energy supplier, procuring capital works through frameworks or investing to make revenue savings</li>
	  <li>you can compare your performance with others – for example, you can see if your running costs are higher than others, understand the reasons and how to make improvements</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Read more about using data to assess the performance of your estate.</p>
	

	<h3 id="strategic-review">Strategic review</h3>
	

	<p>A strategic review is a way to help you understand the existing estate and identify options for its future.</p>
	

	<p>It’s a structured process through which you can assess:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>how well the estate is performing</li>
	  <li>whether it meets your needs</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It will help you explore options for change and develop your asset management plan.</p>
	

	<p>You may not need to undertake a strategic review if the estate is small or you have a clear direction for its future.</p>
	

	<h4 id="the-importance-of-a-strategic-review">The importance of a strategic review</h4>
	

	<p>Your educational and organisational priorities and needs may change over time. You need to understand how the estate helps you meet those needs now and in the future.</p>
	

	<p>A strategic review will provide you with a complete picture of the estate. It will help you make informed decisions about the estate.</p>
	

	<p>The estate may comprise a number of buildings and sites. You can undertake a review of:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the whole estate at the same time</li>
	  <li>groups of assets in a particular area</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You could phase your reviews so that you review the whole estate over a period of time.</p>
	

	<p>Undertaking a review will help:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>make sure the estate is actively used to deliver efficiencies</li>
	  <li>make savings or generate income</li>
	  <li>identify which assets are costly and not fit for purpose</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Without an understanding of the whole estate, there is a risk that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>decisions on the future of individual assets are taken in isolation</li>
	  <li>solutions may not deliver best value</li>
	  <li>you may miss opportunities to deliver efficiencies</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="who-should-undertake-a-strategic-review">Who should undertake a strategic review</h4>
	

	<p>A strategic review should be led by an executive leader. They should be responsible for the estate. They will need input and support to carry out the review effectively. It’s their responsibility to get input as required. The process is not an issue just for the property or school business professional.</p>
	

	<p>You will need to draw on a lot of data and information about the estate and how it’s used. This might involve many people and you should set out what is expected from everyone.</p>
	

	<p>You should have clear terms of reference for the review, including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>reference to the trustees of the school and diocese</li>
	  <li>clear reporting lines</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It’s important that the outcome of the review is formally reported at a senior level.</p>
	

	<h4 id="what-should-be-in-a-strategic-review">What should be in a strategic review</h4>
	

	<p>A strategic review should take account of both financial and non-financial issues. These should be combined with technical property issues to provide a wide understanding and inform decision-making.</p>
	

	<p>You should set out the criteria for how you will assess the estate’s performance. This should be agreed at the outset and applied consistently across the whole estate.</p>
	

	<p>Criteria to consider for each asset could include understanding:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>whether it is sufficient for its current purpose and for future needs (sufficiency)</li>
	  <li>whether it is fit for its current purpose (suitability)</li>
	  <li>whether it is fit for another purpose</li>
	  <li>how much it costs to run</li>
	  <li>what works will be needed in the future to maintain it, and how much will this cost</li>
	  <li>what works are needed to improve it and how much will this cost</li>
	  <li>what restrictions there are that affect what you can do, such as tenure or land ownership issues</li>
	  <li>whether there are any critical timelines that affect when you need to do things, such as the end of a lease or a date for renewal</li>
	  <li>whether there are options for rationalisation or working with other organisations</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>In assessing performance against your selected criteria, you should take account of relevant guidance and benchmarks. This should include understanding space requirements and how you use your space. Guidance on this can be found:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>Building Bulletin 103 (mainstream schools)</li>
	  <li>Building Bulletin 104 (SEND and alternative provision)</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should also understand the need for long-term provision of school places in your area, and consider these needs in your review. This should include identification and consideration of how to meet future needs using the estate. You could consider the potential for using modular buildings to meet these needs.</p>
	

	<p>You should ensure that the review is sufficiently challenging. This could involve identifying sensitive options.</p>
	

	<p>The findings of the review should be reported in accordance with the agreed terms of reference.</p>
	

	<p>At the end of the review, you should make clear recommendations about what to do with the estate. You could use the review process to categorise each asset in the estate. This will help you prioritise your resources and avoid waste.</p>
	

	<p>The categories you use should meet your needs.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
	

	<p><strong>Retention</strong> – where the asset is assessed as being fit for purpose now and for the foreseeable future. There will be ongoing running and maintenance costs.</p>
	

	<p><strong>Improvement and investment</strong> – where the asset is assessed as being worthy of investment to make sure it will be fit for purpose now and for the foreseeable future. There will be an initial investment to bring it up to the required standard and ongoing running and maintenance costs.</p>
	

	<p><strong>Alternative use</strong> – where the asset is assessed as not fit for its current purpose but is fit for another purpose. There may be costs associated with the adaptation or conversion to the alternative use and ongoing running and maintenance costs.</p>
	

	<p><strong>Disposal</strong> – where the asset is assessed as not fit for purpose and not worthy of investment. There may be a capital receipt and costs associated with a disposal. Thereafter there will be savings in running costs and maintenance costs. There may be restrictions or consents required before any disposal can take place.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>The outcome of the review will inform your AMP and maintenance programme.</p>

	<h2 id="developing-an-estate-vision">Developing an estate vision</h2>
	

	<p>Your estate vision should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>be aligned to your educational vision</li>
	  <li>have a clearly defined medium to long-term vision</li>
	  <li>be signed off by your board</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The estate vision should be a high-level statement aligned with your educational vision. It will take account of your educational and local community needs. It provides the direction for the estate, and sets out what needs to happen in the estate in the medium to long-term.</p>
	

	<p>It will make sure:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>that the estate can meet your organisation’s current and future education needs</li>
	  <li>there’s long-term provision of suitable school places in your area</li>
	  <li>that school places reflect the need for choice and diversity</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>In schools supported by a charitable trust, the estate vision must align with the trustees of the school’s educational vision. In schools with a religious character, it must also align with the vision of the diocesan bishop/diocesan board of education.</p>
	

	<h3 id="the-importance-of-the-estate-vision">The importance of the estate vision</h3>
	

	<p>The estate vision will give clear direction and inform decision-making.</p>
	

	<p>Without it there’s a risk that decisions:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>are made in isolation</li>
	  <li>don’t support the school’s (or the trustees of the school’s) educational vision</li>
	  <li>will waste resources</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="who-should-produce-the-estate-vision">Who should produce the estate vision</h3>
	

	<p>An executive leader responsible for the estate should produce the vision. The process is not an issue just for the property or school business professional. They should work with relevant stakeholders, including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the local authority</li>
	  <li>other education providers</li>
	  <li>community groups</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The estate vision should be formally approved by the board as part of business planning. In schools with a religious character, this will be the trustees of the school and the relevant Church of England or Catholic diocese.</p>
	

	<h3 id="what-should-be-in-an-estate-vision">What should be in an estate vision</h3>
	

	<p>The estate vision does not need to be complex or lengthy.</p>
	

	<p>There is no prescribed format. It should meet your needs and be written in a way that:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>fits with your other strategic documents</li>
	  <li>meets the requirements of the trustees of the school</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Make sure you show how the important elements of the educational vision will be achieved through the estate.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	If your educational vision includes to:</p>

	  <li>increase places to address rising demand within the local area in the next 3 years</li>
	  <li>ensure the safety and security of all school users and visitors</li>
	  <li>develop a specialisation such as sports provision in a specified time period</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Your estate vision may be to:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>provide the extra space to meet the number of new places needed locally in the next 3 years</li>
	  <li>ensure all buildings on the estate provide safe and fit for purpose accommodation</li>
	  <li>provide the necessary space and facilities to develop the required specialism</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	

	<p>Your estate vision should not detail how the vision is achieved. That should be in the estate strategy.</p>
	

	<p>You should review the document alongside your educational vision. This will make sure it reflects any changes in educational priorities.</p>
	

	<h2 id="developing-an-estate-strategy">Developing an estate strategy</h2>
	

	<p>Your estate strategy should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>explain how you will carry out the estate vision</li>
	  <li>cover the next 3 to 5 years</li>
	  <li>be signed off by your board</li>
	  <li>be reviewed alongside the estate vision</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>An estate strategy sets out what you need to do with the estate to achieve the estate vision. It’s a 3 to 5 year medium to long-term strategy and will:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>help you understand what you need from the estate</li>
	  <li>set out potential options to achieve your needs</li>
	  <li>identify issues that will need further consideration</li>
	  <li>provide a framework for property-related decision-making</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You may identify a range of potential options to achieve the strategic aims. The estate strategy will not analyse the options in detail, but you must make sure that the options you choose are realistic and achievable. The options identified should be considered in detail at a later stage, through a formal option appraisal process.</p>
	

	<h3 id="the-importance-of-an-estate-strategy">The importance of an estate strategy</h3>
	

	<p>Your estate strategy will help you coordinate all your property-related activities and make sure that they relate to the estate vision. This will focus the short-term and day-to-day activities on what you are trying to achieve.</p>
	

	<p>Make sure you identify, assess and address any impact of property-related activities. Individual solutions and projects are often linked. Without a strategy for the estate as a whole there’s a risk of:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>wasting resources through duplication or redressing the outcome of actions</li>
	  <li>conflicting with other strategic aims</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should record any risks that may arise if works are not strategically planned. This will allow you to manage and mitigate risks, and prioritise work.</p>
	

	<h3 id="who-should-produce-the-estate-strategy">Who should produce the estate strategy</h3>
	

	<p>An executive leader responsible for the estate should produce your estate strategy. The process is not an issue just for the property or school business professional.</p>
	

	<p>They will need input from:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>members of the executive leadership team</li>
	  <li>charity trustees</li>
	  <li>trustees of the school</li>
	  <li>school business professionals or specialists</li>
	  <li>local authorities</li>
	  <li>diocese or other religious authority or body</li>
	  <li>other educational providers</li>
	  <li>community groups</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>If you are considering major or complex developments, you may want to consider asking an external expert to help you at this stage.</p>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	If you are not clear about:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>land tenure, you may need legal advice</li>
	  <li>whether you can make changes to the building, you may need architectural or structural advice</li>
	  <li>how to phase or coordinate different projects, you may need strategic planning advice</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	

	<p>The estate strategy should be approved at board level (and by trustees of the school) as part of business planning.</p>
	

	<p>This will encourage everyone to be involved in the production and make sure that the board takes responsibility for the estate strategy.</p>
	

	<h3 id="producing-an-estate-strategy">Producing an estate strategy</h3>
	

	<p>When producing the estate strategy you should think about all options for achieving the estate vision, considering how realistic they are.</p>
	

	<h3 id="financial-issues">Financial issues</h3>
	

	<p>What is a realistic budget?
	What are the financial constraints?
	Is the budget time limited?
	Are there separate funding streams that can be brought together to support common goals?</p>
	

	<h3 id="educational-issues">Educational issues</h3>
	

	<p>Will the project affect existing school operations?
	Will you lose existing facilities?
	Will changes to layout cause problems?</p>
	

	<h3 id="legal-and-land-title-issues">Legal and land title issues</h3>
	

	<p>Is land ownership clear?
	Are there any restrictions to the title?
	Is any additional land required?
	What approvals or consents are needed?</p>
	

	<h3 id="community-expectations">Community expectations</h3>
	

	<p>Will the local community benefit?
	Will they support your plans?
	Are their expectations clearly articulated?
	Do your plans support wider educational need?</p>
	

	<p>You should consider options strategically and as a whole, highlighting any conflicts.</p>
	

	<p>Once produced, you should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>test the strategy to make sure it’s practical, affordable and effective</li>
	  <li>link it to your school’s financial planning and available budgets</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You should discard any options that cannot be realistically achieved.</p>
	

	<p>Review the strategy against your educational vision once a year. This will make sure it reflects any changes in priorities.</p>
	

	<h3 id="what-should-be-in-an-estate-strategy">What should be in an estate strategy</h3>
	

	<p>Your estate strategy should set out a picture of what the estate might look like in the future.</p>
	

	<p>It should not be too detailed or prescriptive about how this will be achieved.</p>
	

	<p>Your estate strategy should set out:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>your aims</li>
	  <li>how you could achieve your aims (this could include a number of options)</li>
	  <li>things you need to consider further to help you shortlist your options</li>
	</ul>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	If your estate vision is:</p>
	

	<p>“Provide accommodation to meet the number of new places needed locally in the next 3 years.”</p>
	

	<p>Your estate strategy might include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>aim: review the capacity of the existing estate to assess what additional space you need</li>
	  <li>action: liaise with the local authority to understand the medium to longer-term need for places</li>
	  <li>action: consider how you can contribute to addressing demand and identify options to address any shortfall in the existing estate</li>
	  <li>examples: change the internal layout, extend an existing building, build a new building, use a modular build option</li>
	  <li>considerations: what affect the changes might have on other parts of the school, whether you need to get approval to make changes (for example legal, planning or from trustees of the school), if there is sufficient land in the estate</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	

	<p>You should be willing to assess any options recorded in more detail at a later stage, so you need to make sure you are realistic about what you can achieve.</p>
	

	<h2 id="creating-an-asset-management-plan">Creating an asset management plan</h2>
	

	<p>Your asset management plan should:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>set out the actions needed to achieve the estate strategy</li>
	  <li>cover the short to medium term</li>
	  <li>be signed off by your board</li>
	  <li>be reviewed alongside the estate vision and strategy</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>An asset management plan is a short to medium-term plan. It should detail and prioritise what actions you need to take to fulfil the estate strategy.</p>
	

	<p>It will provide the foundation for all estate related activities by:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>setting out or referencing all policies and procedures related to the estate - for example leasing or hiring premises, disposing of or acquiring land and buildings, reporting and responding to maintenance issues, seeking approval for capital expenditure and procuring technical advice</li>
	  <li>setting out or referencing reporting structures and responsibilities - for example estates related governance and managerial hierarchy and who makes decisions about what</li>
	  <li>making sure that activities have a specific purpose - for example making sure that all operational activities are undertaken to achieve a known outcome and do not waste resources</li>
	  <li>co-ordinating and managing all estates activities - for example identifying all estates activities that will be undertaken and grouping them to ensure they are undertaken as efficiently as possible</li>
	  <li>bringing together all land and buildings related data - for example identifying what estates related data and information there is, and making sure it can be accessed and used by everyone who needs it</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>It should reference all land and buildings (assets) in the estate.</p>
	

	<h3 id="the-importance-of-an-asset-management-plan">The importance of an asset management plan</h3>
	

	<p>Your asset management plan will help you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>make decisions based on an understanding of the current condition and performance of the estate</li>
	  <li>protect the occupants of the school</li>
	  <li>reduce and prioritise maintenance need</li>
	  <li>control running costs</li>
	  <li>make sure unplanned urgent works are responded to effectively</li>
	  <li>efficiently source and procure property and construction related services</li>
	  <li>provide a good fit between education requirements and the property from which it’s provided</li>
	  <li>provide good accommodation for all the users of the school</li>
	  <li>make sure appropriate health and safety management arrangements are put in place for project delivery</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You will always have competing demands on your resources. Your asset management plan is an important tool to make sure you use them as efficiently as possible. It will help you balance what you:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>want to achieve in your estate vision</li>
	  <li>need to achieve to meet statutory and educational objectives</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>This will make sure you prioritise works to ensure your estate is safe for all users.</p>
	

	<p>Understanding what works are required will help you identify what resources you need to provide a planned and structured estate management service.</p>
	

	<h3 id="who-should-produce-an-asset-management-plan">Who should produce an asset management plan</h3>
	

	<p>Your asset management plan should be produced by an executive leader. They should be responsible for the estate and could be a school business or property professional.</p>
	

	<p>They will need information and support to produce the asset management plan. It’s their responsibility to get input, as required, from those with organisational and/or managerial responsibilities such as:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the management team</li>
	  <li>charity trustees</li>
	  <li>trustees of the school</li>
	  <li>diocese or other religious authority or body</li>
	  <li>those involved in operational activities</li>
	  <li>strategic and technical property specialists</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You may also involve a range of other stakeholders to help produce and implement your asset management plan.</p>
	

	<p>You should consider who and how many people you involve.</p>
	

	<p>Potential stakeholders you might want to consider include:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>finance officers</li>
	  <li>data managers</li>
	  <li>school business professionals</li>
	  <li>teaching and support staff</li>
	  <li>academy trust boards</li>
	  <li>board of governors</li>
	  <li>local authority children’s services and landlord representatives</li>
	  <li>diocesan boards</li>
	  <li>community groups and parents</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Who you involve should reflect the size and complexity of the estate, your estate vision and your business planning processes. Those involved should make a contribution to the asset management plan by having:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>an understanding of your objectives and goals</li>
	  <li>a good working knowledge of your day-to-day property operations and issues</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>The executive leader must manage the expectations of stakeholders and ensure the asset management plan is produced in a transparent way.</p>
	

	<p>The production of all or parts of the asset management plan may be delegated to those with operational property expertise. It will be the responsibility of the executive leader to coordinate all the input.</p>
	

	<h3 id="producing-an-asset-management-plan">Producing an asset management plan</h3>
	

	<p>You should start planning for the production of your asset management plan as soon as you can, even if you’re waiting for further information.</p>
	

	<p>Review your asset management plan when you review your estate strategy as it may need updating to reflect strategic changes.</p>
	

	<h3 id="what-to-consider">What to consider</h3>
	

	<p>Your asset management plan will be informed and shaped by a number of factors, including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>your organisation - such as governance, budgeting, property performance and data management and procurement policies</li>
	  <li>safety - such as health and safety legislation and buildings related statutory compliance</li>
	  <li>land and buildings issues - more technical factors such as condition, maintenance, suitability, sufficiency and tenure</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>You will need to take all these factors into consideration when you produce your asset management plan. You should work with your business resource planning colleagues.</p>
	

	<p>You will need to understand:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>what information and data is held about the land and buildings in the estate</li>
	  <li>how performance of the estate is measured and managed</li>
	  <li>what the priorities are over the period of the asset management plan</li>
	  <li>what resources are available</li>
	  <li>who is responsible for the different property functions and how issues are reported</li>
	  <li>your governance arrangements and how decisions are made on estate matters</li>
	  <li>your policies for managing the land and buildings in the estate</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
	

	<p>Maintenance of the estate will be an important element of your asset management plan. You should aim to plan as much maintenance work as you can, rather than carrying out works reactively. It is recognised good practice to allocate planned preventative maintenance and reactive maintenance budgets in the region of a 70:30 ratio (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA)).</p>

	<h3 id="what-should-be-in-an-asset-management-plan">What should be in an asset management plan</h3>
	

	<p>There is not a standard asset management plan suitable for all estates. The level of detail and complexity in your asset management plan will depend on many factors including:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>the size and make up of the estate</li>
	  <li>the condition of the estate</li>
	  <li>what you need to do to achieve your estate strategy</li>
	  <li>what you need to do to make the estate safe</li>
	  <li>your governance arrangements</li>
	</ul>
	

	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong>
	For small schools or those with a single site, your asset management plan could be set out within a single document, and make reference to other existing material.</p>
	

	<p>For larger schools, or MATs with multiple sites, your asset management plan could be split into separate documents and make reference to other existing material.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>Your asset management plan does not need to incorporate all estates related material into a single document.</p>
	

	<p>Some policies and procedures may exist and be held within organisational governance arrangements. What is important is that you take account of these policies and procedures and reference them when you produce your asset management plan.</p>
	

	<p>Whether your asset management plan is a single document or a set of documents, you may want to group the content into sections.</p>
	

	<h4 id="introduction-and-estate-strategy">Introduction and estate strategy</h4>
	

	<p>This should set out the:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>purpose and scope of the asset management plan</li>
	  <li>estate vision and objectives</li>
	  <li>estate strategy</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="organisational-framework">Organisational framework</h4>

	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="estate-management-policies-and-procedures">Estate management policies and procedures</h4>

	  <li>estates management policies</li>
	  <li>framework to manage the performance of the estate</li>
	  <li>relevant operational procedures</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="the-estate">The estate</h4>
	

	<p>This should set out:</p>
	

	<ul>
	  <li>a summary of all the land and buildings (assets) in the estate</li>
	  <li>what is required of the estate (and possibly individual assets)</li>
	  <li>how the estate (and possibly individual assets) is performing against key performance indicators</li>
	  <li>if there are any performance shortfalls and the reasons for this</li>
	  <li>what works or projects are priorities</li>
	  <li>what resources are available</li>
	  <li>a prioritised action plan with estimated resource implications</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4 id="estate-management-implementation">Estate management implementation</h4>
