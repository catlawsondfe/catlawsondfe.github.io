    <p>As leaders, you will be responsible for setting a positive ethos within the school which supports respectful relationships and creates a culture in which all children are safe to learn. As part of this ethos, teachers will avoid the use of scare tactics in lessons or assemblies, which might leave pupils feeling unwilling to participate or to vocalise their own assumptions or beliefs. While pupils need to understand the law around sexual violence and sexual harassment, a strong or exclusive focus on the law and criminal behaviour may dissuade pupils from speaking honestly and seeking help.</p>
<p>Ofsted’s review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges noted that culture change begins with an environment in which staff model respectful behaviour.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Relationships education should be clearly aligned with the ethos and values that are modelled within the school.</p>
<p>A supportive school culture will teach children and young people how to respectfully negotiate differences and disagreement, and encourage children and young people to appropriately challenge authority and understand their own boundaries.</p>
<p>Policies within the school should flow from the school’s ethos and align with what pupils are learning within relationships education, including behaviour and discipline or relationship policies, safeguarding and reporting policies. This will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>considering how to involve pupils in the development of relevant policies – see the section on involving pupils in curriculum design for practical suggestions for how pupils might be involved</li>
  <li>involving everyone in the school and ensuring that safeguarding and child protection underpin all relevant aspects of process and policy development</li>
  <li>developing and implementing behaviour policies, in line with the behaviour in schools guidance, which creates an environment in which everyone is treated respectfully, feels safe and that they belong, shaming is always avoided and all pupils are treated with dignity</li>
  <li>making sure school behaviour policies are clear about what constitutes sexual harassment and sexual violence, that pupils know how to seek help and report concerns, and understand the processes that will be followed when concerns are reported</li>
  <li>identifying and addressing barriers to reporting safeguarding concerns within the student population and ensuring that staff are able to recognise the signs of abuse and respond appropriately</li>
  <li>developing conflict resolution processes which enable children and young people to develop skills in communicating and recognising boundaries, while also being aware of the sensitivities around asking victims to directly confront perpetrators without adequate support</li>
  <li>being mindful of any victim-blaming language - being aware that language that blames or shames victims can be subtle</li>
</ul>
<p>Whole school messages about behaviour policies and safeguarding should be coordinated with relevant RSHE lessons. For example, given the evidence about the age at which young people experience different forms of sexual harassment, it may be appropriate to ensure that all pupils from the beginning of their secondary school education understand the consequences of violating school rules or the law, including not sharing unsolicited sexual imagery and not requesting nudes. This can be supplemented by discussions within RSHE about why these rules are important and how they relate to human rights.</p>
<p>Consider how to build in relevant topics including respect, consent, and boundaries, into school assemblies and other whole school events like whole school reading time. Be aware that focusing on the dangers and risks of sex and sexual relationships, without giving a more complete picture, could potentially shake pupils’ trust in the learning they receive.</p>
<p>Within your curriculum planning, look for opportunities for cross-curricular learning about the key topics within relationships education, including understanding consent, respect, and stereotypes and prejudice. We know that books can shape pupils’ behaviour around violence and that texts which portray specific views on gender roles have the ability to encourage or discourage violence, including sexual violence.</p>
<p>Find opportunities to celebrate historical characters or characters from literature who model empowerment even in the face of prejudice or marginalisation. Evidence shows that when topics within relationships education are reinforced through the teaching of other subjects including social studies, English, PE, maths, music and art, this can contribute to an affirming and inclusive school environment.</p>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-developing-a-cross-curricular-whole-school-approach">Example: developing a cross-curricular whole school approach</h3>

<p>In school X, pupils have weekly personal, social, health education lessons, but each curriculum and year team have also worked to embed RSHE strands into the medium-term planning for each subject. Inclusivity is promoted throughout the school curriculum, and teachers ensure that literature is representative and diverse, including LGBT and other marginalised characters.</p>

<p>A weekly assembly for all children focuses on mental health and wellbeing, including elements of RSHE, bringing in core foundational concepts such as autonomy, respect and kindness. The school finds regular opportunities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>signpost pupils to sources of internal and external support both inside and outside school</li>
  <li>explain who pupils can report concerns to</li>
</ul>

<p>The school takes a joyful approach to whole school relationships education, finding opportunities to celebrate empowerment and positive relationships within assembles and other whole-school events. Pupils are taught why we celebrate historical figures (such as Martin Luther King) who have said ‘no’ to behaviours that disrespected others or more recent figures (such as Malala Yousefzai, Greta Thunberg) and how they often had to keep on saying ‘no’ for a while before they were heard; these examples are used to emphasise why it’s important for our self-esteem to not allow others to wear us down if we feel strongly about our ‘no’. These examples are used as a springboard for discussing the importance of respecting other people’s views and consent.</p>

<p>Pupils are aware of the long-term benefits of healthy positive relationships and appropriate self-expression within relationships. Assemblies are not used to shame pupils but are opportunities to highlight the importance of healthy relationships and give pupils examples of the pleasure and happiness that healthy relationships can provide.</p>

    <p>You are free to determine how to deliver RSHE content effectively within your school. However, you should take into account the evidence that RSHE teaching is more effective if delivered regularly throughout the school year, rather than in short bursts of intensive learning, such as drop-down days.</p>
<p>Paragraph 251 of the Ofsted inspection handbook states that Ofsted will expect the school’s relationships, sex and health education curriculum (and wider curriculum) to specifically address sexual harassment, online abuse and sexual violence. The curriculum should also address safeguarding risks (including online risks), issues of consent, and what constitutes a healthy relationship both online and offline.</p>
<p>Curriculum planning will be most effective when based on the aims and principles of RSHE education, considering the RSHE statutory guidance. RSHE leads should consider the role of RSHE in the school, being clear about the impact on pupils and their mental health now and later. Principles might include being fully inclusive, responsive to the needs of all pupils, pro-active, non-judgmental and aiming to reduce sexual violence. Aims and principles can link to the over-arching objectives of the course as a whole.</p>
<p>The section of this guidance on involving pupils in curriculum design includes suggestions for how you might work collaboratively with pupils to identify priorities within the school or student body, for example through school councils.</p>
<p>RSHE will be most effective when planned as a spiral curriculum. This means a curriculum where topics are revisited over the child’s school years in increasing depth to reinforce knowledge, using prior knowledge to inform future learning. For example, in early years and key stage 1 pupils might be introduced to the concept of emotional self-awareness, and discuss how important it is to recognise when something makes them feel uncomfortable, and their right to say no. In secondary, pupils might apply this knowledge specifically to relationships involving sexual content or sexual activity.</p>
<p>You should tailor your curriculum planning to take into account the particular needs and abilities of your pupils. For example, when discussing forms of sexual harassment that we know affect pupils from a young age, such as sharing unwanted sexual images, and engaging in unwanted sexual language, you should take into account data about the ages at which young people are affected by these issues. You should also consider data about the age at which young people are likely to view pornography and other online content.</p>
<p>A recent BBFC report found that 51% of 11 to 13-year-olds, 66% of 14 to 15-year-olds, 79% of 16 to 17-year-olds had viewed pornography. Over 60% of 11 to 13-year-olds who had viewed pornography said that this had been unintentional.</p>
<p>Ofsted’s review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges found evidence that suggests access to technology and the sharing of inappropriate images (for example, sending nudes) and videos are also issues in primary schools.</p>
<p>In Ofsted’s questionnaire of more than 800 young people aged 13 and above, high proportions of girls said that the following types of harmful sexual behaviours happened “a lot” or “sometimes” between people their age:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sexist name-calling (92%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rumours about their sexual activity (81%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unwanted or inappropriate comments of a sexual nature (80%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being sent pictures or videos they did not want to see (88%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being put under pressure to provide sexual images of themselves (80%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having pictures or videos that they sent being shared more widely without their knowledge or consent (73%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being photographed or videoed without their knowledge or consent (59%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having pictures or videos of themselves that they did not know about being circulated (51%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sexual assault of any kind (79%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feeling pressured to do sexual things that they did not want to (68%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unwanted touching (64%)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-planning-age-appropriate-teaching-about-the-impact-of-the-online-world-on-relationships">Example: planning age-appropriate teaching about the impact of the online world on relationships</h3>

<p>School X is an all through school which teaches about positive relationships directly, and also addresses the stereotypes and normative assumptions within media and the online world. Starting in early years and continuing throughout primary, the school provides strong examples of positive relationships, including friendships and later on romantic relationships within literature and films. The school discusses in a joyful way with young people what makes their relationships fun and happy. From early years, pupils are also encouraged to identify stereotypes and assumptions in books and other media. This is approached in a positive, fun way, with pupils empowered to create their own culture which is free from stereotypes and prejudices.</p>

<p>In secondary, the PSHE lead is keen to add an academic dimension to the relationships education curriculum, as pupil voice has shown that a significant number of students do not value this subject, preferring to spend time instead on subjects which lead to externally-accredited qualifications. The PSHE lead looks for opportunities in the RSHE curriculum to draw links with other subjects including history and to draw out relevant themes from set texts in English literature. At key stage 3 pupils explore the impact of mainstream media on friendships and the way we treat others generally.</p>

<p>The PSHE lead has planned a curriculum that discusses online depictions of sexual relationships, including those represented in pornography and social media. Pupils examine academic research about the impact of pornography on real-life romantic or sexual relationships, and are introduced to high-level vocabulary that can be used to explore the impact of pornography on consent and personal boundaries, such as desensitisation, sexual scripts, pseudo-soothers and instrumentalising. The teachers have high levels of training and are able to discuss how sexual scripts within pornography can shape our culture and expectations about sex and relationships. The PSHE lead is clear about separating academic learning about pornography and online media from sex education content.</p>

<p>This lesson is supplemented at the school debating club, where pupils in key stages 4 and 5 have developed their own topics for debate, including the extent to which the mainstream media (such as social media, computer games and music videos) can be said to have changed ideas around consent and boundaries within romantic or sexual relationships. Pupils reflect on their understanding of what “normal” romantic or sexual behaviour is, and how this might impact their understanding of consent. For example, if it’s normal to kiss on a first date, does this mean that you don’t have to check whether kissing is welcome before you kiss someone you’re on a date with? If you think it’s normal to send nudes to a girlfriend, does this mean you don’t need to check if that’s okay before you do so?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="understanding-your-pupils">Understanding your pupils</h3>
<p>As well as taking into account relevant data, you should also take into account your own understanding of the particular circumstances of your pupils, including religious and cultural backgrounds. As stated in the statutory guidance, these topics must be taught sensitively and inclusively, with respect to the backgrounds and beliefs of pupils and parents. Early conversations with the designated safeguarding lead (DSL) can help shape the curriculum and support pupils who may be particularly impacted by any content or may have experienced related traumas.</p>
<p>Your RSHE planning should ensure that you have a strong narrative that the whole school community can understand so that pupils, parents and teachers can see how learning will progress over the pupil’s school career. Involving parents in curriculum planning can both help bring parents on board and also support the crucial role of parents in modelling and teaching about healthy relationships at home. Curriculum planning should give consideration to the needs of all pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>Effective RSHE planning will require teachers to regularly assess their pupils’ knowledge and progress, which may be through quizzes which cover important content, or through reflective exercises. Assessment should also look at pupils’ progress, to help teachers identify the impact of their teaching. RSHE leads will also want to regularly review and assess the content and delivery of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Pupils will engage more actively with the topics when foundational learning has been effective, and pupils have a grounding in concepts from philosophy or psychology, such as autonomy, respect, dignity, and attachment theory. We know that experiential learning is vital for effective learning in these subjects.</p>

    <p>Curriculum planning should look for opportunities to reinforce RSHE learning and practice relevant skills in other areas of the curriculum, including literacy, English literature, history, sociology, physical education. Within team sports, for example, there is great potential for experiential learning of relationships skills in a context where some young people will be more receptive than they are when sitting in a classroom. Teachers might use set texts in English literature to illustrate non-consensual behaviour or, for more advanced pupils, to discuss cultural norms which might perpetuate gendered power dynamics.</p>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-using-literacy-in-primary-to-develop-rshe-concepts">Example: using literacy in primary to develop RSHE concepts</h3>

<p>School X incorporated the book ‘NO! Don’t Touch Me There’ by Nomthi Odukoya into their literacy curriculum. Teachers used this book to talk to pupils about their bodies, improper behaviour and the importance of boundaries and privacy. The narrative facilitated conversations about abuse (using age-appropriate language) and the importance of children talking to their trusted adult if they felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Other books studied in literacy which included relationships, friendships, and risk-taking were mapped to coincide with RSHE lessons so that the behaviours of characters or themes could be explored together.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-using-english-literature-in-secondary-to-reinforce-rshe-concepts">Example: using English literature in secondary to reinforce RSHE concepts</h3>

<p>School X developed their scheme of work on ‘Of Mice and Men’ in Key Stage 4 English Literature to promote discussion around sexism in relation to Curley’s wife (who is unnamed), racism towards Crooks, and ableism in Lennie. Teachers discuss derogatory language and discriminatory attitudes to women and girls through analysis of Curley’s wife, who is called a bitch, a tart, jailbait, skank, tramp and compared to Candy’s dog. Teachers use the marriage as an example to discuss coercive control and gaslighting. Further discussions can draw out the importance of communication, love and respect in relationships and identify what help is available to escape a physically or mentally abusive relationship or coercive control.</p>

<p>Fiction writing, drama games, oracy techniques and art might be used to support the development of emotional intelligence as a key ingredient of respectful relationships. For example, you might encourage younger pupils, in their creative writing, to identify emotions like anxiety, unhappiness, and loneliness. You might encourage older pupils to demonstrate their understanding of peer pressure, reputational risk, vulnerability, and the impact of social isolation. Teaching about emotions is also a part of mandatory health education.</p>

<p>History lessons might include content which contextualises discussions of power imbalances for primary pupils, and misogyny and sexual violence for secondary pupils. This content can be explicitly linked back to relationships education and sexual abuse in particular. In subjects such as history or politics, teachers weave in learning about conflict resolution, using relevant political conflicts as a springboard for an examination of conflict resolution in personal relationships; this is critical in establishing the difference between trying to understand another’s perspective, seeking to encourage another’s participation in a positive way and asking them to compromise their core values.</p>

    <p>A strong RSHE curriculum which effectively supports healthy relationships and addresses sexual harassment and sexual violence will respond to the specific concerns of pupils within the school. Similarly, lessons will be most effective if they clearly relate to the lived experience of children and young people, including those with SEND or who identify as LGBT. Involve pupils in designing the curriculum and in questions about how the curriculum is delivered, including external speakers. Testing the vocabulary and approach with a group of young people can both support high-quality curriculum planning and also give pupils a sense of ownership over the curriculum. Pupil involvement in curriculum design can also be incorporated into RSHE lessons, by devoting time to a small group discussion within a lesson to review RSHE provision.</p>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-involving-pupils-in-curriculum-design">Example: involving pupils in curriculum design</h3>

<p>School X used an extra-curricular group focused on empowerment for female pupils as a focus group to learn about pupils’ experiences of sexual harassment, and to co-create a questionnaire to be completed by all pupils in the school. The questionnaire asked pupils about attitudes and behaviours in relation to romantic or sexual relationships. The questionnaire also asked pupils about the physical school environment and how safe they feel in different school spaces. Pupils supported the staff to ensure vocabulary was accessible and questions reflected their concerns, whilst staff worked to ensure the questionnaire was as inclusive as possible. The school staggered questionnaire completion to ensure that the safeguarding team could respond to any resulting disclosures.</p>

<p>The questionnaire revealed confusion among pupils about what constitutes sexual harassment and what to do about it.  The school then worked with a diverse group of pupils to develop a reporting policy, and to refine relationships education lessons focusing on sexual harassment. The school decided to repeat the questionnaire every 3 years to inform curriculum planning and add discursive working groups of pupils every year and adapt the curriculum in light of these discussions to meet the needs of pupils and ensure that the course is constantly responsive to their needs.</p>

<p>School X timetables weekly lessons for all year groups in which RSHE is taught. Staff presented their relevant lesson plans to the girls’ group to check the vocabulary and approach. The lessons were then taught to every year group during their timetabled lesson.</p>

<p>The school followed up with staff training addressing the findings of the questionnaire and clarifying what constitutes sexual harassment, as well as communicating the ‘student friendly’ policy to staff and pupils.</p>

    <p>In considering who best to teach content on healthy relationships, sexual harassment and sexual violence, you will need to think about the existing skills and interests of your teaching staff. Consider staff who already have a background or interest in related topics such as ethics, psychology, sociology or psychotherapy. Diversity among teaching staff will both support effective learning and also avoid a default in which women take the lead on these subjects.</p>
<p>The Ofsted review was clear that effective RSHE teaching will require expertise from a trained PSHE or RSHE lead for curriculum planning and that RSHE teachers should have adequate training and knowledge. There is strong evidence that effective, up-to-date, and regular training is essential to delivering high-quality RSHE including training on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how to approach subjects that might feel uncomfortable for teachers or their pupils</li>
  <li>being confident in answering hard questions</li>
  <li>establishing rapport in the classroom while introducing sensitive topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence shows that consistent and validated training is needed to increase the confidence and the understanding of contemporary issues (for example, online abuse and relationships) of teachers and other professionals. Practical and experiential training is likely to support teachers’ confidence and ability.</p>
<p>All staff are involved in teaching and modelling healthy relationships, whether or not they are classroom RSHE teachers and regardless of the age or subject they teach. You can ensure that messages are consistent by ensuring that all staff within the school understand the key principles of healthy relationships. Regular training for teaching staff will help maintain a focus on high-quality relationships education and modelling healthy relationships, as well as ensuring that staff are up to date. Bias training for staff will also help address any harmful or prejudiced assumptions. You can support a healthy school culture by ensuring that all staff have support to understand their own relationship patterns and recognise their crucial role in modelling healthy relationships.</p>
<p>You can support teachers by celebrating the expertise of RSHE teachers within the school, and recognising the richness and complexity of these subjects.</p>
<p>Providing all staff with the time and opportunity to reflect on the content they are teaching, as well as to challenge their own assumptions, stereotypes and prejudices, can support a healthy school culture.</p>
<p>Be aware that many members of your workforce are likely to have had adverse experiences, including sexual violence and sexual harassment. It is important to acknowledge the lived experience of staff and ensure that there is support for teachers, including signposting to local services. Teachers should have plenty of notice of the content they are expected to cover and be given an early opportunity to raise any concerns or issues. Similarly, pupils should know the topics in advance. You should not expect teachers to deliver topics which they may find traumatising because of previous experiences, and should actively protect staff wellbeing in these cases.</p>
<p>Ensure that you have a staff team that is supported and feels confident and excited to deliver this work and that adequate support, as well as training, is in place for staff. As well as ongoing, regular training opportunities, you can use teaching practice and teacher role plays to support formal training. Mentoring and other activities can help build teachers’ confidence. Ensure that all teachers are aware of reporting procedures. You should be mindful of the importance of creating a culture in which staff can express their reservations about the content to be taught, and say when they are not feeling confident to teach so that problems can be addressed.</p>
<div class="example">
<h3 id="example-building-teachers-confidence">Example: building teachers’ confidence</h3>

<p>As part of their work to address sexual harassment, school X conducted a survey to establish current levels of staff knowledge, skills and confidence to deliver RSHE. The survey asked what support teachers would find useful, with options including internal/external training, coaching and mentoring, team teaching and observing other staff.  The survey revealed gaps in teachers’ confidence to challenge discriminatory language and answer difficult questions. The school delivered whole school staff training focused specifically on these skills. The RSHE lead set up a shared drive for staff to share anecdotes, good practices and ideas, to encourage a partnership approach. Less confident staff were given access to coaching or mentoring sessions with the RSHE lead.  The survey is to be repeated annually.</p>

<p>For relationships education to be effective, it needs to be delivered by staff who are equipped to handle difficult questions and tackle harmful assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-slt-and-rshe-leads">Tips for SLT and RSHE leads</h3>

<p>Don’t assume that all staff understand the importance of teaching controversial topics within relationships education. An open conversation in which staff have an opportunity to express reservations may be a good opportunity to challenge teachers’ assumptions.</p>

<p>Some teachers will lack the confidence to discuss difficult topics: encourage more experienced teachers to be visible and offer to model, team teach, and observe lessons. In some cases, it may be helpful to bring in external expertise, and this should be appropriately integrated into regular lessons.</p>

<p>Local authority teams including neighbourhoods, safeguarding and public health teams can provide localised support and data, along with local violence reduction units and school nursing teams.</p>

    <p>Ofsted’s <a rel=external href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges">review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges</a> recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">a carefully sequenced RSHE curriculum, based on the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) statutory guidance, that specifically includes sexual harassment and sexual violence, including online. This should include time for open discussion of topics that children and young people tell us they find particularly difficult, such as consent and the sending of ‘nudes’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The review found that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pupils would welcome more complex teaching about consent and said that they could deal with more challenging content than teachers realised</li>
  <li>young people would like more teaching about consent in established relationships</li>
  <li>teaching needs to be explicit about what counts as unacceptable behaviour</li>
  <li>parents want more support in talking to their children about these issues, and Ofsted found a particular gap in parents’ understanding of online sexual abuse</li>
  <li>unwanted sexual language is normalised in schools and can be effectively addressed through RSHE</li>
</ul>
<p>How your school addresses harmful sexual behaviour, including through the curriculum, will form an important part of Ofsted inspections.</p>
<p>Paragraph 67 of the <a rel=external href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif">Ofsted inspection handbook</a> states that during section 5 inspections, Ofsted will look at how leaders ensure that their school’s culture addresses harmful sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>Inspectors will expect schools to assume that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence are happening in the community, and potentially in the school, even when there are no specific reports, and put in place a whole-school approach to address them. Schools should have appropriate, clear and well-communicated school-wide policies in place that make it clear that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence (including sexualised language) are unacceptable. Those policies should be consistently reflected throughout the school (see paragraphs 235, 251 and 314 to 316).</p>
