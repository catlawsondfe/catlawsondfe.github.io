                            <p>Do daily tasks with your child. Talk about what you are doing and why you are doing it. When hanging up the washing, you could say ‘The clothes are wet, let’s hang them up to dry.’ Give them simple tasks like passing you the socks. Praise them for helping.</p>

                            <p>Sing songs together that encourage your child to use their imagination. For example, try singing <a href="https://small-talk.org.uk/2-3-years/play/wheels-bus/" rel="noopener">The Wheels on the Bus</a> and ask your child to suggest other things on the bus and describe what sound they make.</p>
<hr />
<p>Read picture books together. Talk about the things they can see and how we use them. For example, &#8216;A bed is something we sleep in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Use books to talk about your own experiences, and theirs, giving them time to respond. &#8216;Oh look, there is a cow. What sound do cows make?&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p>Talk to your child about what has happened so far in the day – for example, &#8216;We spoke to Grandma on the phone this morning, didn’t we?&#8217; And talk about what is going to happen next – &#8216;After lunch we’ll do the washing up.&#8217;</p>

<hr />
<p>When you’re sharing a book with your child, sit close together or even build a den to sit in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Put on some music and play &#8216;musical statues&#8217;. Dance together then stop the music – see who will be the first person to stand still.</p>

                            <p>Try sharing familiar books at bedtime. Pause when reading so that your child can join in. Talk about the sounds at the beginning of words and words that start with the same sound (like words beginning with P).</p>
<hr />
<p>Encourage your child to recall what has happened in the story. For example, ‘Why is bear feeling sad?’ Ask them to guess what might happen – ‘What should they do next?’ – or how the story might end – ‘Do you think they’re going to find the treasure? Where could it be?’</p>

                            <p>Play teddy bears’ picnic. Put soft toys in a circle and give your child a few cups and spoons. Give your child a chance to tell you what to do like, &#8216;Stir teddy’s tea.&#8217; You could chat to them as you are doing actions, for example, &#8216;let’s cut the cake in half.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p>Start conversations by using open questions with lots of possible answers, for example, &#8216;What are you going to play with today?&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p>Plan a treasure hunt game, where your child has to listen to your instructions to find a clue or an object. For example, ‘Try looking behind the sofa’. Help your child look for a specific number of objects and count them together – such as 3 cups, 2 pink socks, 5 pens.</p>
<hr />
<p>Play sorting games together. Collect a range of different household objects and practise sorting them into different groups, perhaps by size or colour. Once you have finished, count all the objects in each group.</p>

<hr />
<p>Help your child make a puppet show about their favourite story using objects around the house.</p>
<hr />
<p>Play a make-believe journey game with your child. Make a car out of a cardboard box that you decorate together, or just grab some cushions, pile in a few teddy bear passengers, and let your child drive you off on an adventure.</p>

<p><strong>Fun</strong> &#8211; Will your child enjoy the app? Will it keep their attention?</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong> &#8211; Is there a clear educational aim? Do you know what your child will learn? Will it keep them learning and allow them to progress?</p>
<p><strong>Engaging</strong> &#8211; Will it help your child if they get stuck? Will it give them feedback and let them know when they&#8217;ve got challenges right?</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> &#8211; Is it attractive and easy to use? Is it inclusive and does it avoid gender and racial stereotypes? Can an adult change the settings? Is it safe, with links to the internet and adverts protected behind a parental gate?</p>
