      <p>From September 2020 schools will be required to teach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relationships education (primary schools)</li>
  <li>relationships and sex education (RSE) (secondary schools)</li>
  <li>health education (state-funded schools only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Independent schools will be required to teach personal, social and health education (PSHE). Sex education is not compulsory in any primary school, but may be taught if the school chooses.</p>

<p>This section gives some basic principles to help school leaders plan and prepare for the new statutory curriculum. Schools have the flexibility to design their own programme to ensure it meets the needs of pupils and the community, as well as the statutory requirements.</p>

<p>Head teachers and teachers must read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education">statutory guidance</a> in full.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-policy-for-the-new-curriculum">Creating a policy for the new curriculum</h2>

<p>All schools must have a policy in place.</p>

<p>Policies are typically approved by governors.</p>

<p>You will need to have decided the outline of your teaching programme before finalising the policy.</p>

<p>Possible headings are included in the statutory guidance but you could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what topics are taught at primary, and in which terms and years</li>
  <li>how the programme is taught (class teachers, visiting speakers, assemblies etc)</li>
  <li>how religious backgrounds of pupils are taken into account</li>
  <li>how ‘off script’ questions from pupils will be handled</li>
  <li>whether sex education is taught – if so, clarity for parents on right to withdraw</li>
  <li>how the policy is produced, including any consultation with parents</li>
  <li>reference to any requirements on schools in law e.g. the Equality Act</li>
  <li>when policy updated and who approves (for example, your governing body)</li>
  <li>how you will ensure appropriate access for pupils with SEND or how you might approach teaching about LGBT relationships in the context of family</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the school’s policy has been approved, and where that policy includes a year by year breakdown of topics plus a summary of the school’s approach to sensitive issues, that is what teachers are required to implement.</p>

<p>Where parents have complaints about that approach which cannot be re-solved through informal discussion then they should follow the school’s (curriculum) complaints policy.</p>

<h3 id="integration-to-whole-school-ethos">Integration to whole school ethos</h3>

<p>Schools should have a statement of values and ethos anyway, and may include personal qualities it seeks to foster.</p>

<p>Relationships and Health Education should link to or be referenced in that statement.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
 “as a school we value diversity and foster mutual respect, modelling and inspiring attributes in pupils such as 	respect, courtesy and honesty.  These underpin and inform the relationships we have, between pupils and between adults and pupils …”</p>
</div>

<p>Where a school has a specific religious ethos, this will normally be referenced in the ethos statement and may be alongside a reference to the importance of respect for others in society.</p>

<h2 id="link-between-primary-and-secondary">Link between primary and secondary</h2>

<p>The statutory guidance specifies the topics that primary and secondary pupils must be taught and know by the end of each phase. It gives content for primary and secondary, but not by key stage or year. This is because the ‘age and developmentally appropriate’ judgement will vary by school and context.</p>

<p>Using your knowledge of your pupils and school community you can choose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduce secondary requirements in primary with pupils who are ready (with parental consultation and consent where required)</li>
  <li>root secondary teaching in the primary requirements, if pupils need to build knowledge before they progress (likely to be needed as the new curriculum is introduced)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress-and-transition-to-secondary">Progress and transition to secondary</h3>

<p>Progress and understanding should be assessed as pupils move through school, and topics revisited as necessary. Baselining activities should be carried out as pupils transition from phase to phase, and any gaps in understanding of primary content addressed.</p>

<p>Schools such as academy trusts or those supported by a local authority advisor might consider working together across the primary and secondary phases to ensure teachers are clear on what has already been covered and that teaching progresses smoothly from Key Stage to Key Stage.</p>

<h2 id="engaging-parents">Engaging parents</h2>

<p>Once you have prepared your programme and drafted your policy, consider offering a parents’ and carers’ event to inform, reassure, listen and discuss.</p>

<p>Set out your approach to the subjects fully and clearly.</p>

<p>Consider the topics or areas you think parents may be interested in or have questions about (if you are choosing to teach sex education (this is optional at primary) it is likely to include that. Other topics that parents or carers may have questions about include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>puberty</li>
  <li>how you take account of religious backgrounds in teaching</li>
  <li>teaching about different types of family</li>
  <li>safeguarding</li>
  <li>online information</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, show parents the resources you will use and walk them through some sequences of teaching.</p>

<p>Listen to feedback sensitively and where appropriate feed into your planning or teaching approaches.</p>

<p>However, consultation with and listening sensitively to the views of parents does not mean that parents have a right of veto for topics set out in the statutory guidance, or when schools judge that it is appropriate to teach them.</p>

<p>We have produced guides for parents for schools to use which give a summary of the subjects.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-an-existing-programme-of-study">Adapting an existing programme of study</h2>

<p>Many schools who are planning their programme for relationships and Sex Education and Health Education will be doing so within a broader PSHE framework.</p>

<p>These schools can choose to teach the new compulsory content within that framework, where their model supports delivery and meets the needs of their pupils. RSHE and PSHE do not need to be seen as separate subjects.</p>

<p>PSHE remains non-statutory in maintained schools although the new subjects cover much of the content typically included in a PSHE programme. PSHE continues to be compulsory in independent schools.</p>

<p>Schools may equally adopt other curricular models.</p>

<p>Before you plan the new teaching you need to audit your current curriculum plan against the statutory requirements. Your school may already have some provision in place that will support delivery. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessment processes that can be adapted for RSHE</li>
  <li>a wider school ethos of inclusion, for example, anti-bullying procedures</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="taking-a-pedagogical-approach">Taking a pedagogical approach</h2>

<p>Be clear about your approach to pedagogy and connect to wider school approaches.</p>

<p>In general, what we know about how children are best taught applies to these subjects as to all others.</p>

<p>Resources produced by others may imply an approach to pedagogy which does not match the evidence or does not match your school’s overall approach – be aware of that and adapt accordingly.</p>

<p>Teaching should clearly explain the knowledge and concepts needed, and provide adequate opportunities for pupils to practise and apply knowledge and concepts so that they are embedded in the long term memory and build towards a coherent understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>You can deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical components</li>
  <li>ensuring pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject</li>
  <li>working with experienced colleagues to accumulate and refine a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and demonstrations</li>
  <li>using resources and materials aligned with the school curriculum (e.g. textbooks or shared resources designed by experienced colleagues that carefully sequence content)</li>
  <li>being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts</li>
</ul>

<p>A good summary of what we know about effective pedagogy and how to apply it is in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers">Early Career Framework</a>.</p>

<h2 id="planning-your-programme">Planning your programme</h2>

<p>Relationships Education, RSE and Health Education complement several national curriculum subjects.</p>

<p>Where schools are teaching the national curriculum, they should look for opportunities to draw links between the subjects and integrate teaching where appropriate.</p>

<p>There continues to be no right of withdrawal from any part of the national curriculum.</p>

<p>For example, it may be helpful to know in secondary schools when relevant aspects of science (biology) are taught in relation to sex education.</p>

<p>Or be aware when and how physical education covers the benefits of an active lifestyle and cardiovascular exercise</p>

<p>Or how content in computing relates to online content in RSE.</p>

<p>Or when literary texts which touch on emotional aspects of relationships are studied in English</p>

<h3 id="points-to-consider-when-planning-your-programme">Points to consider when planning your programme</h3>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular lessons –for example weekly or fortnightly slot in class taught by class teacher</li>
  <li>a teacher or other appropriate adult in school who teaches a particular topic to all classes in turn</li>
  <li>whole school / key stage assemblies, either led by staff at school or by a carefully selected external speaker or expert</li>
  <li>map out terms, years and key stages and decide which topics you will cover when</li>
  <li>some topics are likely to be suitable for KS2 or later KS2</li>
  <li>other topics are relevant at all stages so may need to be covered two or three times (e.g. year 1, year 3, year 5; or year 2 and year 4 etc) or in some cases very frequently (e.g. core concepts about friends and families)</li>
  <li>don’t overlook basic socialisation you do anyway as a contributor to aspects of relationships education e.g. turn-taking, listening to others’ views, being polite, holding doors for others etc –try to capture these as you plan</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-an-lgbt-inclusive-programme">Designing an LGBT inclusive programme</h2>

<p>The statutory guidance says “schools should ensure that all of their teaching is sensitive and age appropriate in approach and content. At the point at which schools consider it appropriate to teach their pupils about LGBT, they should ensure that this content is fully integrated into their programmes of study for this area of the curriculum rather than delivered as a stand-alone unit or lesson. Schools are free to determine how they do this, and we expect all pupils to have been taught LGBT content at a timely point as part of this area of the curriculum.”</p>

<p>The statutory guidance states that all pupils should receive teaching on LGBT relationships during their school years. The guidance is clear that secondary schools should include LGBT content in their teaching.</p>

<p>Primary schools are enabled and strongly encouraged to cover LGBT content. This would be delivered, for example, through teaching about different types of family, including those with same sex parents.</p>

<h3 id="how-some-primary-schools-may-approach-this">How some primary schools may approach this</h3>

<p>Primary schools often choose to teach this in the broader context of teaching about respect for all or family, e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Families: diversity of family types to include LGBT families; marriage/civil partnership may be between two people of same sex under British law</li>
  <li>Respectful relationships: that LGBT people (in school or more widely) may be subject to bullying or negative comments but that is wrong, how it might make them feel</li>
  <li>Online relationships: that negative or bullying comments about anyone, including LGBT people or families online are as damaging and wrong as in school or face to face</li>
</ul>

<p>Primary schools are enabled and strongly encouraged to cover LGBT content.</p>

<p>Different family types which could include single parents, foster parents, grandparents and same-sex parents could feature in books from KS1 or early KS2. Sometimes little discussion may be needed at this stage.</p>

<p>Early discussions in KS1 or early KS2 about the impact of bullying or importance of respecting others could include examples of children in LGBT families.</p>

<p>In KS2 pupils could be taught the basics of what marriage is, and be told that under British law people of the same sex may also marry and choose to live as a family.</p>

<p>In KS2 pupils may be taught about stereotypes, and LGBT stereotypes may be included here, along with the damaging impact of thinking about or treating people as stereotypes.</p>

<p>In KS2 pupils learn about online safety. This includes how to behave online and how to report bad behaviour –this may include online harassment of people for actual or perceived sexuality or gender identity.</p>

<h3 id="how-some-secondary-schools-may-address-this">How some secondary schools may address this</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Families: family configurations to include LGBT families; marriage/civil partnership may be between two people of same sex under British law</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respectful relationships: that LGBT people (in school or more widely) may be subject to bullying or negative comments but that is wrong, and how it might make them feel; stereotypes discussion to cover a range of contexts where stereotypes may be encountered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online relationships: that online pornography misrepresents and distorts all kinds of relationships and sex, including for LGBT people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intimate and sexual: when learning about the characteristics of emotionally secure and healthy relationships or learning about sexual health, STIs and prevention include information relevant to LGBT relationships</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-equality-act-and-public-sector-equality-duty">The Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty</h2>

<p>Schools are required to comply with relevant requirements of the Equality Act 2010. Chapter 1 of Part 6 of the Act applies to schools. As an example, Part 6 of the Act makes it unlawful for a school to discriminate against, harass or victimise a pupil or potential pupil in relation to admissions or in how the school is run.</p>

<p>The content of the school curriculum is exempt from the duties imposed on schools by Part 6 of the Equality Act. Excluding the content of the curriculum ensures that schools are free to include a full range of issues, ideas and materials in their syllabus, and to expose pupils to thoughts and ideas of all kinds, however challenging or controversial, without fear of legal challenge based on a protected characteristic.</p>

<p>State-funded schools are required, in discharging their functions, to have due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Act</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
</ul>

<p>Relevant protected characteristics are :</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>sex and sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst this does not mean that schools are required to teach about the Equality Act or the protected characteristics, they many choose to do so in teaching their pupils about respect for difference and in the context of other requirements, such as promoting fundamental British values and the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils.</p>

<p>Section 149 of the Equality Act sets out the public sector equality duty, which applies to all state funded schools.</p>

<p>In summary, the PSED requires such schools, in their decision-making, to have due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dealing-with-sensitive-issues">Dealing with sensitive issues</h2>

<p>What is sensitive or likely to give parents or teachers cause for anxiety may vary according to the context of the school.</p>

<p>In all schools by law, the religious background of all pupils must be taken into account when planning teaching of Relationships Education.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean not teaching some issues but may mean particular care is taken over the framing of such issues, or additional time taken to ensure parents are clear about how issues are to be taught.</p>

<p>In some cases sharing and explaining teaching materials may be a good strategy; sometimes a sample teacher script may be used to give teachers and parents confidence in an approach on a specific topic.</p>

<p>Schools with a designated religious ethos may also teach their faith teachings or perspectives but should also ensure that they have regard to the statutory guidance –indeed any school is free to address faith perspectives.</p>

<h2 id="developing-examples-to-help-teachers">Developing examples to help teachers</h2>

<p>An exemplar ‘script’ can be a helpful tool for teachers to rehearse how they will deliver a topic. You could create your own exemplars as a team to suit your school and ethos.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example ‘script’ on puberty</strong>
“As you start to grow up, your body starts to change (physical changes) and your feelings start to change (emotional changes). This is called puberty.</p>

<p>Different people start puberty at different ages, and it can take some time for all these changes to happen.The age at which you start puberty is not important and has nothing to do with the kind of adult you will become.</p>

<p>It is ok to have questions or worries about puberty and you can talk about anything that is on your mind with a teacher, parent or with other trusted grown-ups.”</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example ‘script’ on LGBT and religious backgrounds</strong></p>

<p>“The majority of people who follow the teachings of (religion) may choose to live in families consisting of a man, woman and children. Some religious people will see this as a preferred way of living. The law in this country allows and respects the right of people to live in families such as this. However, the law also gives people the right to live in other families. You may come across families where two men or two women have chosen to live together or marry and bring up children together. That family is also allowed under the law in this country and we respect the rights of people to live in different families.”</p>

<p>“If we meet children who live in different sorts of families to those we are familiar with, it is wrong to say bad things about them or to bully them. Like their parents and their families, they are entitled to the same respect as everyone else.”</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example ‘script’ on mental well-being and sleep</strong>
“Recent evidence shows the importance of sleep for mental health, physical health, eating, and attentiveness during the day. Lack of sleep can affect your everyday functioning.</p>

<p>What works best to manage this? Some people build ‘wind down’ time before bed, putting aside electronic devices. What does the evidence show about the importance for sleep to be uninterrupted by phones and other things?</p>

<p>Here is what the evidence tells us about the indicative amount of sleep needed e.g. for a 6 month-old baby, a 7, 10, 15 year old and an adult to ensure good health.”</p>
</div>

<h2 id="handling-awkward-questions">Handling awkward questions</h2>

<p>Teaching in these subjects should allow appropriate opportunities for pupils to ask questions to check and test their understanding/</p>

<p>Most questions will be relevant to what the teacher has explained, and generally questions should be welcomed –pupils should not feel penalised or censored for asking sensible or relevant questions, even if they are occasionally awkward.</p>

<p>Sometimes, pupils may ask questions which go beyond what the teacher has planned and may stray into sensitive territory/</p>

<p>There is no single way to address all such questions –some may be handled straightforwardly for the whole class to hear.</p>

<p>If a question asks for personal information or personal views from the teacher, it may often be appropriate to direct the focus back to the topic and examples given. There is no obligation on the teacher to offer information personal to themselves or personal views. The focus should be on the subject matter planned and agreed for teaching by the school. This can be set out in ground rules at the start of lessons.</p>

<p>Teachers should of course be mindful that a question may occasionally raise a possible safeguarding concern, and the school’s safeguarding process should be followed in such cases.</p>

<h3 id="primary-schools">Primary schools</h3>

<p>Some questions may relate to sex education which the school may not be teaching, or not yet. These should generally not be answered in front of the whole class.</p>

<p>Strategies include offering a word outside the lesson, referring to another more senior member of staff, offering a simple ‘holding’ answer and mentioning the question to parents at the end of the day.</p>

<h3 id="secondary-schools">Secondary schools</h3>

<p>Where questions arise outside of these lessons relating to sex education, and the teacher knows there are pupils in the class whose parents do not wish them to receive sex education in school, particular care should be taken about answering in front of the whole class.</p>

<p>This requires a fine professional judgement, but sometimes in such (relatively rare) cases it may be appropriate to speak discreetly with the pupil asking the question at the end of the lesson to address their question, or to ensure the answer is covered in subsequent teaching which is clearly designated as sex education (providing this pupil is not withdrawn from sex education).</p>

<p>Where a pupil who is withdrawn from sex education asks a question relating to sex education content, teachers should offer a brief ‘holding response’ and, usually via a senior member of staff, draw the issue to the attention of the pupil’s parents.</p>

<h2 id="managing-a-sensitive-class-discussion">Managing a sensitive class discussion</h2>

<p>Occasionally teachers may find that managing a whole class discussion is a useful stage in the teaching of a particular topic.</p>

<p>Whole class discussions can be a useful way to model listening respectfully to the views of others and turn-taking, though in a class of 30 only one person can speak at a time so these discussions should not be over-used.</p>

<p>While ‘distancing techniques’ (using a third party example) can be useful in some cases for sensitive or potentially personal issues, in general, it is not helpful to invite pupils to ‘act’ roles which may be controversial in such discussions – it is better to allow them to ask their own genuine questions or express their own genuine views.</p>

<p>Teachers should manage and lead discussions attentively. If the discussion is at risk of straying, the teachers need to be prepared to redirect it back to intended topics –remember the teacher is in charge at all times.</p>

<p>It is generally not helpful to ask pupils to lead or chair discussions on sensitive topics as there can be a greater risk of going off topic.</p>

<h2 id="using-external-organisations-or-speakers">Using external organisations or speakers</h2>

<p>These can be a powerful and useful way to bring expertise, resources, experience or an impactful personal story to pupils.</p>

<p>However, there are risks and doing thorough due diligence, including looking at recommendations from other schools, is important.</p>

<p>Is this person or organisation credible? Review any case study material and look for feedback from others they have worked with.</p>

<p>Be clear what they are going to say or what line they will take –ask to see materials, slides, film clips, scripts etc in advance.</p>

<p>Make sure you know the named individuals who will be there, check any need for DBS and that there is an agreed protocol should any safeguarding issue arise, for example a disclosure.</p>

<p>Do a basic online search (as parents may do this) and if it throws up anything you or parents would be concerned about address this beforehand.</p>

<p>Check protocols for taking pictures or using any personal data the external speaker may get from the session.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to say no, or in extreme cases stop a session –these are your pupils and you are responsible for what is said to them/</p>

<p>It’s good practice for the teacher to be in the room, so they know what was discussed and can follow up with their pupils. They will also understand what has been discussed if a pupil makes a disclosure later.</p>

<h2 id="right-to-request-withdrawal">Right to request withdrawal</h2>

<p>The school should be clear in their summary planning, which it may be helpful to append to the published policy, when in the programme different aspects of sex education are taught.</p>

<p>The policy should state clearly that parents have the right to request withdrawal from all or part of sex education and tell them whom to contact to make such a request.</p>

<p>When a request is received, best practice is for the headteacher or delegated colleague to meet with the parents to discuss the background to their request, to offer assurances about the approach, and to set out the benefits of pupils accessing sex education in school.</p>

<p>If the parents still want withdrawal after such a discussion, unless there are exceptional circumstances, parents’ request should be granted until 3 terms before the pupil turns 16. For example, if the pupil’s sixteenth birthday is in February of year 11, that point would be February in year 10.</p>

<p>At that point, if the child wishes to be taught sex education, the headteacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms.</p>

<p>Schools should ensure that the tone of these discussions is respectful – parents should not be pressurised unduly to ‘change their mind’ or made to feel guilty for making their request/</p>

<p>If parents decline an invitation to a discussion, their request for withdrawal must still be processed in the normal way.</p>

<p>Once a withdrawal is agreed, schools must implement it until the parent notifies otherwise, or until circumstances change to become exceptional, or until the pupil, having reached 3 terms before they turn 16, asks to receive sex education. Schools should not require parents to re-request annually for example, though it would be good practice to remind parents annually that it is in place and invite them to confirm whether they still want it. A nil response to such a request means that the original withdrawal should still be implemented.</p>

<p>There is no definitive list of ‘exceptional circumstances’, but may include cases where the school has information which suggests a pupil is at risk of exploitation externally to the school.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-withdraw--send">Right to withdraw – SEND</h3>

<p>In the majority of cases there should be no difference in the approach between SEND pupils and all others.</p>

<p>However, in cases where the nature or degree of the pupil’s SEN or disability, possibly combined with their domestic or social circumstances, mean that they are demonstrably very likely to be at unusual risk from sexual activity or sexual exploitation, then the headteacher may judge that an exception should be made.</p>

<p>In such cases a headteacher may decline a parental request for withdrawal.</p>

<p>Conversely, in other rare cases, the nature or degree of the pupil’s SEND may mean that they are not yet ready to receive or understand information envisaged for others, and a decision is taken to adapt, reduce or delay aspects of sex education. This can also be a justifiable decision in some cases.</p>

<h3 id="record-keeping-and-informing-parents">Record keeping and informing parents</h3>

<p>A record should be kept of all discussions with parents and pupils concerning the right to withdraw, exceptions and decisions not to grant it.</p>

<p>These should wherever possible be shared with parents to ensure that all parties are clear about decisions the school is making.</p>

<h2 id="primary-sex-education-where-taught">Primary sex education where taught</h2>

<p>Primaries may already have age-appropriate sex education programmes in place.</p>

<p>No need to change these if they are working well and have parental buy-in.</p>

<p>However, sex education is outside the content defined for Relationships and Health Education (primary), and schools do not need to start teaching Sex Education if they do not wish to (decision ultimately is governors’).</p>

<p>Needs to be clearly set out in policy what approach the school takes.</p>

<p>If a school covers Sex Education content which goes beyond that set out for either Relationships or Health Education, be aware of the parental right of withdrawal at primary –make clear to parents in policy, and set out a practical method for parents to communicate to school, if this is their wish.</p>

<p>Stating clearly exactly what aspects of Sex Education are covered in what terms and years is helpful to allow parents to make this decision.</p>

<p>Primaries are not required to teach Sex Education but must teach Relationships Education and have regard to the statutory guidance in full.</p>

<p>It can be useful for primary schools to look at secondary content in the Guidance when considering this question.</p>

<p>Everything defined in the content for Relationships Education, Health Education and NC KS2 Science does not carry a parental right to withdrawal.</p>

<p>If primary schools’ policy is to teach some aspects of Sex Education, for example points set out in the secondary content, they should clearly set this out in policy and give parents a right to withdraw.</p>

<p>However, it is always good practice to work with, inform and reassure parents even if content does not carry the right to withdraw.</p>

<h2 id="training-needs">Training needs</h2>

<p>Governors need to know their responsibilities and duties, need briefing.</p>

<p>Headteacher and coordinator need to have read the Statutory Guidance.</p>

<p>Teachers need to have read the school policy.</p>

<p>Primary teachers already teach all (most) subjects –need to be confident on the content identified for teaching but no requirement for expertise beyond that.</p>

<p>Teachers ideally need to have explored together and agreed approach to teaching / discussing / fielding questions on sensitive issues –ideally practise (parts of) lessons with each other to fine tune approach and give feedback to each other.</p>

<p>On particularly ‘knowledge rich’ topics e.g. internet and some aspects of health education, planning and resources should be from reliable sources so pupils are not inadvertently given misleading facts, and teachers be guided by that knowledge.</p>

<p>For some topics carefully selected external experts are a possible solution.</p>

<p>Draw on evidence and best practice –subject associations often provide good summaries to support this.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-evaluation">Assessment and evaluation</h2>

<p>Questioning and assessment in class has two functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the act of remembering and applying to new situations helps to embed and secure knowledge and concepts in pupils’ long term memories (definition of learning is a ‘change in the long term memory’)</li>
  <li>their answers to questions shapes teachers’ planning in that lesson and in short and medium term, as it reveals how much is being understood and what needs re-teaching</li>
</ul>

<p>While quizzes and knowledge checks may be useful feedback and identify what knowledge has been securely retained by pupils, emphasis in this subject is on quality provision.</p>

<p>Reporting to parents may reference topics covered and the approach, attitude and confidence of the pupil in lessons.</p>

<h3 id="ofsted-personal-development-judgement">Ofsted: personal development judgement</h3>

<p>Inspectors will evaluate the extent to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the curriculum extends beyond the academic … and provides for pupils’ broader development, enabling them to develop and discover their interests and talents</li>
  <li>the curriculum and the school’s wider work support pupils to develop their character –including their resilience, confidence and independence –and help them know how to keep physically and mentally healthy at each stage of education</li>
  <li>the school prepares pupils for future success in their next steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Inspectors will also evaluate the extent to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the school prepares pupils for life in modern Britain by
    <ul>
      <li>equipping them to be responsible, respectful, active citizens who contribute positively to society</li>
      <li>developing their understanding of fundamental British values</li>
      <li>developing their understanding and appreciation of diversity</li>
      <li>celebrating what we have in common and promoting respect for the different protected characteristics as defined in law</li>
      <li>how curriculum areas such as personal, social, health and economic education, and relationship and sex education contribute to pupils’ personal development</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>provision rather than impact</li>
</ul>
