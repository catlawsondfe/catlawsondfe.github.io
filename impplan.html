	<p>From September 2020 schools will be required to teach:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>relationships education (primary schools)</li>
	<li>relationships and sex education (RSE) (secondary schools)</li>
	<li>health education (state-funded schools only)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Independent schools will be required to teach personal, social and health education (PSHE). Sex education is not compulsory in any primary school, but may be taught if the school chooses.</p>
	
	<p>This section gives some basic principles to help school leaders plan and prepare for the new statutory curriculum. Schools have the flexibility to design their own programme to ensure it meets the needs of pupils and the community, as well as the statutory requirements.</p>
	
	<p>Head teachers and teachers must read the <a rel="external"
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education">statutory guidance</a> in full.</p>
	
	<h2 id="creating-a-policy-for-the-new-curriculum">Creating a policy for the new curriculum</h2>
	
	<p>All schools must have a policy in place for the new curriculum.</p>
	
	<p>Policies are typically approved by governors.</p>
	
	<p>You will need to decide the outline of your teaching programme and consult on the policy before finalising it.</p>
	
	<p>The statutory guidance suggests typical sections you may wish to include in your policy such as:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>details of content/scheme of work and when each topic is taught, taking the age of pupils into account</li>
	<li>whether you’re using any external organisations to teach part of the curriculum</li>
	<li>how the policy has been produced, and how it will be kept under review, in both cases working with parents</li>
	<li>how delivery of the content will be made accessible to all pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)</li>
	<li>an explanation of the right to withdraw pupils from sex education classes</li>
	<li>requirements on schools in law for example, the Equality Act 2010</li>
	<li>how often the policy is updated</li>
	<li>who approves the policy</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where parents have complaints which cannot be re-solved through informal discussion then you should ask them to follow your school’s (curriculum) complaints policy.</p>
	
	<h3 id="integration-to-whole-school-ethos">Integration to whole school ethos</h3>
	
	<p>Schools should have a statement of values and ethos anyway. This may include personal qualities it seeks to foster. You can reference relationships, sex and health education in that statement, or link to the policy for the new curriculum instead.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
	
	<p>“As a school we value diversity and foster mutual respect, modelling and inspiring attributes in pupils such as respect, courtesy and honesty. These underpin and inform the relationships we have, between pupils and between adults and pupils …”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a school has a specific religious ethos, this will normally be referenced in the ethos statement about the importance of respect for others in society.</p>
	
	<h2 id="deciding-what-to-teach-at-primary-and-secondary-level">Deciding what to teach at primary and secondary level</h2>
	
	<p>The statutory guidance specifies:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>what topics need to be taught at primary level and secondary level</li>
	<li>what pupils should know by the end of each level</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It does not break the curriculum up by key stage, year group or age. This is because decisions about when to teach topics will vary by school and context.</p>
	
	<p>Using your knowledge of your pupils you can choose to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>introduce secondary requirements in primary with pupils who are ready (with parental consultation and consent where required)</li>
	<li>include primary requirements in secondary teaching if pupils need to build knowledge before they progress (this is likely to be needed as the new curriculum is introduced)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Try to identify what pupils already know at the start of a lesson or topic. Topics should be revisited as necessary.</p>
	
	<p>You should address any gaps in understanding of primary content when teaching secondary school pupils.</p>
	
	<p>Consider working with your academy trusts or local authority across the primary and secondary phases to help make sure:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>teachers are clear on what has already been covered</li>
	<li>teaching progresses smoothly from key stage to key stage</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="engaging-parents-and-carers">Engaging parents and carers</h2>
	
	<div class="call-to-action">
	<p>Read our advice on <a rel="external"
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/engaging-parents-with-relationships-education-policy">engaging parents on relationships education</a> which explains why it is important to engage with parents and gives tips on how to do this.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Once you have prepared your programme and drafted your policy, consider offering an event for parents and carers to inform, reassure, listen and discuss.</p>
	
	<p>Set out your approach to the subjects fully and clearly.</p>
	
	<p>Consider the topics or areas you think parents may be interested in or have questions about. For example, if you are a primary school choosing to teach sex education (which is optional at primary level), parents might want know more about that decision.</p>
	
	<p>Other topics that parents or carers may have questions about include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>how you’re teaching about puberty</li>
	<li>how you take account of religious backgrounds in teaching</li>
	<li>teaching about different types of family</li>
	<li>what you’ll do if you identify safeguarding issues</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you can, show parents the resources you will use and walk them through some sequences of teaching.</p>
	
	<p>Listen to feedback sensitively. Where appropriate feed into your planning or teaching approaches.</p>
	
	<p>Consulting with and listening sensitively to the views of parents does not mean that parents have a right of veto for topics set out in the statutory guidance, or when schools judge that it is appropriate to teach them.</p>
	
	<p>Use our <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-sex-and-health-education-guides-for-schools">guides for parents</a> to help communicate with them about the new curriculum and what it includes.</p>
	
	<p>Some parents of children with SEND may particularly want to engage with schools about what will be taught, particularly as some pupils will be more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation than their peers. Some pupils may also find it difficult to understand the difference between public and private behaviour.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that all children have an equal opportunity to learn what sorts of behaviour are and are not acceptable and that parents have the opportunity to support classroom learning at home.</p>
	
	<h2 id="adapting-an-existing-programme-of-study">Adapting an existing programme of study</h2>
	
	<p>Many schools who are planning their programme for relationships and sex education and health education will be doing so within a broader PSHE framework.</p>
	
	<p>You could choose to teach the new compulsory content within the PSHE framework, if your current model meets the needs of their pupils. This new curriculum and PSHE do not need to be seen as separate subjects.</p>
	
	<p>PSHE remains non-statutory in maintained schools although the new subjects cover much of the content typically included in a PSHE programme. PSHE continues to be compulsory in independent schools.</p>
	
	<p>Before you plan your new curriculum, you need to audit your current curriculum plan against the statutory requirements. Your school may already have some provision in place that will support delivery. For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>assessment processes that can be adapted for the new curriculum</li>
	<li>a wider school ethos of inclusion, for example, anti-bullying procedures</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="taking-a-pedagogical-approach">Taking a pedagogical approach</h2>
	
	<p>Be clear about your approach to pedagogy and connect to wider school approaches.</p>
	
	<p>What we know about how children are best taught applies the same to these topics as to all others.</p>
	
	<p>Teaching should:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>clearly explain the knowledge and concepts needed</li>
	<li>provide adequate opportunities for pupils to practise and apply knowledge and concepts so that they are embedded in the long term memory and build towards a coherent understanding of the topic</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, by:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical components</li>
	<li>ensuring pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject</li>
	<li>working with experienced colleagues to accumulate and refine a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and demonstrations</li>
	<li>using resources and materials aligned with the school curriculum (for example, textbooks or shared resources designed by experienced colleagues that carefully sequence content)</li>
	<li>being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>A good summary of what we know about effective pedagogy and how to apply it is in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers">Early Career Framework</a>.</p>

	
	<h2 id="planning-your-programme">Planning your programme</h2>
	
	<p>The new relationships, sex and heath education curriculum complements several other national curriculum subjects.</p>
	
	<p>Look for opportunities to draw links between the subjects and integrate teaching where appropriate.</p>
	
	<p>For example, it may be helpful to know:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in secondary schools when relevant aspects of science (biology) are taught in relation to sex education</li>
	<li>when and how physical education covers the benefits of an active lifestyle and cardiovascular exercise</li>
	<li>how content in computing relates to online and media topic</li>
	<li>when literary texts which touch on emotional aspects of relationships are studied in English</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="points-to-consider-when-planning-your-programme">Points to consider when planning your programme</h3>
	
	<p>When planning your programme you need to decide how you will teach the new curriculum.</p>
	
	<p>Consider mapping out terms, years and key stages to help decide which topics you will cover and when.</p>
	
	<p>You will also need to consider the most appropriate method for teaching certain topics. This could mean having:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>regular lessons – for example weekly or fortnightly slot in class taught by class teacher</li>
	<li>a teacher or other appropriate adult in school who teaches a particular topic to all classes in turn</li>
	<li>whole school / key stage assemblies, either led by staff at school or by a carefully selected external speaker or expert</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="creating-an-inclusive-classroom">Creating an inclusive classroom</h2>
	
	<p>You should consider what it’s like for a diverse range of pupils to be taught about these topics. Having pupils’ needs at the heart of planning ensures a sensitive, caring approach to delivery.</p>
	
	<p>These topics should help all pupils understand their physical and emotional development and enable them to make positive decision in their lives.</p>
	
	<p>Some pupils are more vulnerable to exploitation and bullying because of the attitudes and behaviours some people have towards those who are different from themselves. Pupils of the same age may also be at different stages of cognitive development. Your teaching methods should take account of these factors.</p>
	
	<p>As well as classroom teaching, you may need to include one-to-one discussions, teaching in small groups or targeted sessions for some pupils. </p>
	
	<p>When planning your programme, you will also need to consider:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>some pupils in secondary schools may need to focus on primary content beyond age 11</li>
	<li>the religious background of pupils</li>
	<li>how you frame certain topics</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="the-equality-act-and-public-sector-equality-duty">The Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty</h3>
	
	<p>Schools are required to comply with relevant requirements of the Equality Act 2010. Chapter 1 of Part 6 of the Act applies to schools.</p>
	
	<p>The content of the school curriculum is exempt from the duties imposed on schools by Part 6 of the Equality Act. 
	This means schools are free to include a full range of issues, ideas and materials in their syllabus, and to expose pupils to thoughts and ideas of all kinds, however challenging or controversial, without fear of legal challenge based on a protected characteristic.</p>
	
	<p>State-funded schools are required to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Act</li>
	<li>advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Relevant protected characteristics are:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>age</li>
	<li>disability</li>
	<li>gender reassignment</li>
	<li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
	<li>race</li>
	<li>religion or belief</li>
	<li>sex and sexual orientation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This does not mean that schools are required to teach about the Equality Act or the protected characteristics.</p>
	
	<p>The <a rel="external" rel="external" href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/public-sector-equality-duty-guidance-schools-england">public sector equality duty requires schools</a> to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act</li>
	<li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
	<li>foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils should leave school with a proper understanding of the importance of equality and respecting difference. The guidance for <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-fundamental-british-values-through-smsc">promoting fundamental British values</a> provides some helpful principles to guide practice.</p>
	
	<p>You may want to consider some of the divergent opinions on for example religion and sexual orientation to make sure the teachers have a consistent approach.</p>
	
	<h2 id="supporting-pupils-with-additional-needs">Supporting pupils with additional needs</h2>
	
	<p>Subject leaders should liaise with the class teacher and SENCO to make sure:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the needs of all pupils are met</li>
	<li>the curriculum is fully accessible</li>
	<li>education health care (EHC) plans are followed</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Mainstream schools should ensure that teaching is differentiated to support pupils with SEND to fully access the curriculum. This might include revisiting earlier topics or spending longer on a topic. Effective use of teaching assistants will support this.</p>
	
	<p>Use your own expertise and knowledge to differentiate activities within lessons where needed.</p>
	
	<p>Specialist resources can be used to support effective teaching. Using the picture exchange communication system (PECS) to create resources, or image-based books that allow the pupil to create the story verbally, in writing or digitally can help pupils with or without SEND to articulate learning and manage emotions.</p>
	
	<p>There are specific duties set out in <a rel="external" rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/schedule/10">schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010</a> to support participation of disabled pupils, and in chapter 6 of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">SEND Code of practice</a>, to support participation of pupils with SEND.   </p>
	
	<h2 id="dealing-with-sensitive-issues">Dealing with sensitive issues</h2>
	
	<p>What is sensitive or likely to give parents or teachers cause for anxiety may vary according to the context of the school.</p>
	
	<p>Conversations within the curriculum lessons should not lead to any type of bullying, ostracising or other form of social or emotional harm. Pupils should be aware of this and lessons should be delivered in such a way to ensure this does not happen.</p>
	
	<p>To help create a safe environment for pupils when teaching these topics, consider:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>setting ground rules for lessons, where needed, particularly around not sharing personal information</li>
	<li>stopping discussions if personal information is shared in lessons and following up with pupils later where needed</li>
	<li>not promising confidentiality if a pupil confides something concerning</li>
	<li>telling pupils they can ask for help and they will be taken seriously</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In all schools by law, the religious background of all pupils must be taken into account when planning the teaching of relationships education.This doesn’t mean not teaching some issues but may mean particular care is taken over the framing of such issues, or additional time taken to ensure parents are clear about how issues are to be taught.</p>
	
	<p>To give parents confidence in an approach on a specific topic, consider sharing and explaining teaching materials.</p>
	
	<p>Schools with a designated religious ethos may also teach their faith teachings or perspectives but should also ensure that they have regard to the statutory guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="managing-a-sensitive-class-discussion">Managing a sensitive class discussion</h3>
	
	<p>Occasionally teachers may find that managing a whole class discussion is a useful stage in the teaching of a particular topic.</p>
	
	<p>Whole class discussions can be a useful way to model listening respectfully to the views of others and turn-taking, though in a class of 30 only one person can speak at a time so these discussions should not be over-used.</p>
	
	<h3 id="using-distancing-techniques">Using distancing techniques</h3>
	
	<p>Teachers can also avoid embarrassment and protect pupils’ privacy by always depersonalising discussion.</p>
	
	<p>Distancing techniques can help you when teaching these subjects for example using a case study to illustrate an issue.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils can then talk about a fictional character in the case study without having to share personal information</p>
	
	<p>Teachers should manage and lead discussions attentively. If the discussion is at risk of straying, the teachers need to be prepared to redirect it back to intended topics –remember the teacher is in charge at all times.</p>
	
	<p>It is generally not helpful to ask pupils to lead or chair discussions on sensitive topics as there can be a greater risk of going off topic.</p>
	
	<h3 id="managing-a-sensitive-class-discussion-1">Managing a sensitive class discussion</h3>
	
	<p>Occasionally teachers may find that managing a whole class discussion is a useful stage in the teaching of a particular topic.</p>
	
	<p>Whole class discussions can be a useful way to model listening respectfully to the views of others.</p>
	
	<h3 id="distancing-techniques">Distancing techniques</h3>

	<p>It is generally not helpful to ask pupils to lead or chair discussions on sensitive topics as there can be a greater risk of going off topic.</p>
	
	<h2 id="setting-ground-rules-in-the-classroom">Setting ground rules in the classroom</h2>
	
	<p>Clear class ground rules can help when teaching about sensitive topics. They also support confidentiality and safeguarding of pupils.</p>
	
	<p>Good practice is for ground rules to be:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>discussed and understood by all</li>
	<li>clear and practical</li>
	<li>modelled by the teacher</li>
	<li>followed consistently and enforced</li>
	<li>updated when needed</li>
	<li>visible in lessons</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="handling-awkward-questions">Handling awkward questions</h2>
	
	<p>Teaching in these subjects should allow appropriate opportunities for pupils to ask questions to check and test their understanding.</p>
	
	<p>Most questions will be relevant to what the teacher has explained, and generally questions should be welcomed. 
	Pupils should not feel penalised or censored for asking sensible or relevant questions, even if they are occasionally awkward.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, pupils may ask questions which go beyond what the teacher has planned and may stray into sensitive territory.</p>
	
	<p>There is no single way to address all such questions – some may be handled straightforwardly for the whole class to hear.</p>
	
	<p>If a question asks for personal information or personal views from the teacher, it may often be appropriate to direct the focus back to the topic and examples given.</p>
	
	<p>There is no obligation on the teacher to offer information personal to themselves or personal views. The focus should be on the subject matter planned and agreed for teaching by the school. This can be set out in ground rules at the start of lessons.</p>
	
	<p>Teachers should be mindful that a question may occasionally raise a possible safeguarding concern, and the school’s safeguarding process should be followed in such cases.</p>
	
	<h3 id="primary-schools">Primary schools</h3>
	
	<p>Some questions may relate to sex education which the school may not be teaching, or not yet. These should generally not be answered in front of the whole class.</p>
	
	<p>Strategies include offering a word outside the lesson, referring to another more senior member of staff, offering a simple ‘holding’ answer and mentioning the question to parents at the end of the day.</p>
	
	<h3 id="secondary-schools">Secondary schools</h3>
	
	<p>Where questions arise outside of these lessons relating to sex education, and the teacher knows there are pupils in the class whose parents do not wish them to receive sex education in school, particular care should be taken about answering in front of the whole class.</p>
	
	<p>It may be appropriate to speak discreetly with the pupil asking the question at the end of the lesson to address their question, or to ensure the answer is covered in subsequent teaching which is clearly designated as sex education (providing this pupil is not withdrawn from sex education).</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil who is withdrawn from sex education asks a question relating to sex education content, teachers should offer a brief ‘holding response’ and, usually via a senior member of staff, draw the issue to the attention of the pupil’s parents.</p>
	
	<h2 id="identifying-teachers-needs">Identifying teachers’ needs</h2>
	
	<p>It is essential that teachers can maintain their own wellbeing when delivering the curriculum. There may be times that a topic triggers particular feelings or thoughts, including of historic, recent or current trauma.</p>
	
	<p>It is important for school leaders to appreciate the different nature of this subject, and be understanding of teachers’ individual circumstances and the support they may need.</p>
	
	<p>You may therefore want to engage teachers in considering their own needs in advance.</p>
	
	<p>Teacher training activities may help your teachers feel supported. You might also consider activities that support teachers to reflect on their own values around the subject and consider ways to present an unbiased and evidence-based curriculum to pupils.</p>
	
	<p>Teachers are entitled to share their own beliefs and views, but they must also operate within their school’s agreed policy, the Teaching Standards and comply with the Equality Act.</p>
	
	<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
	<p>Teachers are not required to answer personal questions asked by pupils and should consider, with the support of their school, how best to handle any such questions.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2 id="using-external-organisations-or-speakers">Using external organisations or speakers</h2>
	
	<p>External speakers, tools and resources can be used to enhance and supplement the curriculum.</p>
	
	<p>It is important to be clear about what you want from an external expert, tool or resource, and to consider the range of available providers to ensure you get value.</p>
	
	<p>If you’re using the resources to deliver part of the curriculum, then it is important to make sure the expert, tool or resource meets the outcome of that part of the curriculum.</p>
	
	<p>External experts and resources can also be useful for developing curriculum planning ideas, activities and also identifying age-appropriate outcomes.</p>
	
	<p>External experts could help:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>give advice from local and school-based health and advisory services</li>
	<li>a real life example from someone with a particular life experience, such as a teenage parent or HIV-positive speaker</li>
	<li>learning about a particular faith, cultural or social perspective, for example by a faith leader discussing relationships or a local LGBT+ organisation representative discussing stereotyping and addressing homophobia</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Review any case study material and look for feedback from others they have worked with.</p>
	
	<p>Be clear what they are going to say or what line they will take –ask to see materials, slides, film clips, scripts etc in advance.</p>
	
	<p>Make sure you know the named individuals who will be there, check any need for DBS and that there is an agreed protocol should any safeguarding issue arise, for example a disclosure.</p>
	
	<p>Do a basic online search (as parents may do this) and if it throws up anything you or parents would be concerned about address this beforehand.</p>
	
	<p>Check protocols for taking pictures or using any personal data the external speaker may get from the session.</p>
	
	<p>Don’t be afraid to say no, or in extreme cases stop a session –these are your pupils and you are responsible for what is said to them/</p>
	
	<p>It’s good practice for the teacher to be in the room, so they know what was discussed and can follow up with their pupils. They will also understand what has been discussed if a pupil makes a disclosure later.</p>
	
	<h2 id="choosing-resources">Choosing resources</h2>
	
	<p>There are many resources available to support the delivery of your lessons, these include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>lesson plans</li>
	<li>complete curriculum plans</li>
	<li>other classroom materials such as videos or posters</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Materials used should align to the teaching requirements set out in the statutory guidance.</p>
	
	<p>When deciding if a resource is suitable, you should consider if it:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>aligns to the teaching requirements set out in the statutory guidance</li>
	<li>would support pupils in applying their knowledge in different contexts and settings</li>
	<li>is age-appropriate - think about age, developmental stage and background of your pupils</li>
	<li>is evidence based and contains robust facts and statistics</li>
	<li>fits into your curriculum plan</li>
	<li>from a credible source</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is also important to consider safe practice pedagogy when looking at resources.</p>
	
	<p>Resources should also be sensitive to pupils’ experiences as some may have already been exposed or at risk of content being taught. You should ensure that resources do not exhibit any content that may provoke distress.</p>
	
	<p>The resources you choose should deliver knowledge in a way that supports the building of pupils’ confidence.</p>
	
	<h2 id="right-to-request-withdrawal">Right to request withdrawal</h2>
	
	<p>You should be clear in your published policy, when in the programme different aspects of sex education are taught.</p>
	
	<p>The policy should state clearly that parents have the right to request withdrawal from all or part of sex education and tell them whom to contact to make such a request.</p>
	
	<p>When a request is received, consider meeting with the parents to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>discuss the background to their request</li>
	<li>offer assurances about the approach</li>
	<li>set out the benefits of pupils accessing sex education in school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If parents decline an invitation to a discussion, their request for withdrawal must still be processed in the normal way.</p>
	
	<p>If the parents still want withdrawal after such a discussion, unless there are exceptional circumstances, parents’ request should be granted until 3 terms before the pupil turns 16. For example, if the pupil’s 16th birthday is in February of year 11, that point would be February in year 10.</p>
	
	<p>At that point, if the child wishes to be taught sex education, you must ensure they receive it in one of those 3 terms.</p>
	
	<h3 id="right-to-withdraw--send">Right to withdraw – SEND</h3>
	
	<p>In the majority of cases there should be no difference in the approach between SEND pupils and other pupuils.</p>
	
	<p>However, in cases where the nature or degree of the pupil’s SEN or disability, possibly combined with their domestic or social circumstances, mean that they are demonstrably very likely to be at unusual risk from sexual activity or sexual exploitation, then your headteacher may judge that an exception should be made.</p>
	
	<p>In such cases your headteacher may decline a parental request for withdrawal.</p>
	
	<h3 id="record-keeping-and-informing-parents-and-carers">Record keeping and informing parents and carers</h3>
	
	<p>You should keep a record of all discussions with parents, carers and pupils concerning the right to withdraw, exceptions and decisions not to grant it.</p>
	
	<p>Where possible, you should share records of all discussions with parents and carers to make sure all parties are clear about the decisions.</p>
	
	<h2 id="primary-sex-education-where-taught">Primary sex education (where taught)</h2>
	
	<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
	<p>Primary schools are not required to teach sex education but must teach relationships education and have regard to the statutory guidance in full.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Primary schools may already have age-appropriate sex education programmes in place. There is no need to change these if they are working well and have parental buy in. However, sex education is outside the content defined for relationships and health education in primary schools.</p>
	
	<p>You need to clearly set out in your policy if you are teaching sex education. You must also be aware of the parental right of withdrawal at primary. Make it clear to parents in your policy and set out a practical method for parents to communicate to school, if this is their wish. Stating clearly exactly what aspects of sex education are covered in what terms and years is helpful to allow parents to make this decision.</p>
	
	<p>Parents can’t withdraw their child from:</p>

	<li>relationships education</li>
	<li>health education</li>
