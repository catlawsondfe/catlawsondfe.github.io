	<h3>How to help your child develop</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Play with your child with things they are interested in.</li>
	<li>Notice what your child is looking or pointing at and talk about it. Try to do this within a couple of seconds, before their attention moves on to something else.</li>
	<li>Picture books are a good way to introduce your child to new things!</li>
	<li>Take turns, even with young babies you can respond to their babbling.</li>
	<li>Make reading, singing and playing fun by using lots of actions, different voices and repetition.</li>

	<p>At mealtimes, give your child choices, so that they can hear and understand more words. For example, ‘Do you want some grapes or a banana?’ Make sure you give them time to answer.</p>

	<p>Say the names of the foods your child is eating and talk about what they’re like, using words like ‘sweet’, ‘sour’, ‘round’, ‘smooth’ ‘cold’, ‘warm’.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Pretend to be a rabbit as you bite into a carrot, or a mouse nibbling some cheese. Make sure that both you and your child have some food to try!</p>
	<hr />
	<p>At bedtime try looking at picture books together. Give your child time to point out things to you. Talk about what they can see using words for actions as well as for things – for example, ‘the baby is sleeping.’</p>

	<hr />
	<p>Talk to your child about what has happened so far in the day – for example, ‘we did the washing this morning, didn’t we? We hung all the clothes up to dry.’ And talk about what is going to happen next – ‘After breakfast, we will go to the park.’</p>

	<p>Encourage your child to recall what has happened in the story. For example, ‘Why is the dinosaur grumpy?’ Ask them to guess what might happen – ‘What should they do next?’ – or how the story might end – ‘Do you think there will be a tiger in the garden? Where could it be hiding?’</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Ask your child if they can give possible solutions to problems, for example when getting dressed in the morning can they find their favourite hat which is missing?</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Start conversations by using open questions with lots of possible answers, for example, ‘What is your favourite toy?’, ‘What do you want to do tomorrow?’</p>

	<p>When sharing familiar books, pause when reading so that your child can join in. Talk about the sounds at the beginning of words and words that start with the same sound (like words beginning with P).</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play games like, ‘I spy with my little eye something beginning with…’ and say the first sound of the thing that you can see – ‘something beginning with b-b-b-b.’ You can go first and show your child how the game works.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Think of as many rhyming words as you can for different objects you can see. For example, if you can both see a tree, then think of as many words as you can that rhyme with it like bee, knee, me.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play Follow the Leader. Make sure you talk about what you’re doing and repeat words lots of times! For example, ‘Simon says shake your hands, shake, shake, shake’, ‘Simon says stamp your feet, stamp, stamp, stamp’. Include opposites in the instructions (up/down, stop/go, loud/soft, high/low) and take turns!</p>

	<p>Play a make-believe journey game with your child. Make a space rocket out of a cardboard box that you decorate together, or just grab some cushions, pile in a few teddy bear passengers, and blast off on an adventure.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Try role-playing games together such as shopping. Set items out on the sofa, give your child a bag and some pretend money. Then switch roles and let them be the shopkeeper.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Play teddy bears’ picnic. Put soft toys in a circle and give your child a few cups and spoons. Give your child a chance to tell you what to do like, ‘give teddy some tea.’ You could chat to them as you are doing actions, for example, ‘let’s cut the cake in half’.</p>

	<hr />
	<p>Obstacle courses are great fun and can help your child to listen and learn new words. You can play them inside or outside, just give your child some instructions. Say &#8216;crawl under the blanket&#8217; or &#8216;sit in the box&#8217; or &#8216;jump to the corner&#8217;. Take turns so that they can practice giving the instructions too.</p>
